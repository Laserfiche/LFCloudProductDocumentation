        <h1>New Features in Laserfiche Cloud 2019.2</h1>
        <p>The Laserfiche Cloud 2019.2 update, released on April 18, 2019, includes a variety of new features.</p>
        <p>Watch an overview of the new features here:<iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/New-Features-Cloud-20192/New-Features-Cloud-20192-Update_player.html"></iframe></p>
        <h2>Documents</h2>
        <h3>Flexible Records Management Enhancements</h3>
        <p>Records management has been improved to allow organizations more flexibility in how records are handled. Administrators can now allow users to make modifications to document metadata (though not to file content) when a document is under retention. In addition, cutoff criteria is now optional in retention schedules.</p>
        <h3>Repository Audit Log Retention</h3>
        <p>You can now customize the length of time that your repository audit logs will be retained. Audit logs can be retained for a specified period of time, or indefinitely. In addition, if there are any active holds in your repository, all audit logs will be retained until the holds have been resolved.</p>
        <h3>Performance Enhancements</h3>
        <p>The <i>Within folder</i> advanced search will now return results more quickly in some situations, especially for folder trees with less than 100 subfolders. In addition, load times are shorter when loading the folder browser.</p>
        <h2>Process Automation</h2>
        <h3>Additional Query Data Sources</h3>
        <p>You can now query a wider variety of data sources when configuring a data query rule. Where you could previously query only Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL databases, you can now also query Oracle and MySQL databases. You can also query CSV files that are hosted on an external server.</p>
        <h3>Laserfiche Home Screen</h3>
        <p>The Laserfiche home screen provides a central access point to your tasks, documents, and reports. From the home screen, you can view a dashboard displaying key metrics. The home screen also allows you to directly access other Laserfiche Cloud services such as managing your business process tasks, submitting forms, and viewing reports on business processes and your repository.</p>
        <h3>Business Processes</h3>
        <p>Business Processes in Process Automation brings the design and management functionality of Laserfiche Forms into Process Automation and adds new reporting options. You can view detailed reports and graphics on your business processes, including information like task completion times, potential bottlenecks, and field values from form submissions. </p>
        <p>When configuring lookup rules in a form, you can now use Process Automation Rules, integrating information stored in decision tables, formulas, or entities into business processes.</p>
        <h3>Surveys</h3>
        <p>Surveys in Process Automation are a method for collecting data using forms, without having to configure a full-fledged business process. You can view reports on data collected from the surveys, similar to viewing reports on business processes.</p>
        <h3>Unified Query Editor</h3>
        <p>You can now query entities and external data sources using the same user interface. Entity models are treated like tables in a database in the new query editor, which works for both entity queries and external data queries.</p>
        <h3>Custom Fields in Salesforce</h3>
        <p>The Salesforce integration now lets you interact with custom fields that you've created in Salesforce. You can configure access to these custom fields in the connection profile associated with your Salesforce connection. Then, you can use Workflow to create, updated, or delete these fields.</p>
        <h3>Anchor Text Pattern Matching in Capture Profiles</h3>
        <p>You can now apply pattern matching to anchors to account for variations in a zone’s anchor text and help locate the data you want to capture. For example, business licenses may label the name of the business Name, Business Name, Granted To, Company, etc. By using a pattern to find all the different variants of business name labels, you will be able to capture the business name, regardless of which business name label it follows. Additionally, user interface enhancements have been applied to test results when testing a capture profile, including the ability to see a preview of the sample and test documents and their OCRed text.</p>
        <h2>Laserfiche App</h2>
        <h3>Sign-in Usability Updates</h3>
        <p>The Laserfiche app has a new sign-in flow that lets users access their repository and forms more efficiently.</p>
        <h3>Improved PDF Support</h3>
        <p>To match Android support, you can now see PDF annotations when viewing a PDF and zooming in on a PDF retains the zoom level when scrolling through pages on iOS. On both iOS and Android, editable fields on a PDF can now be modified within the app. In addition, PDFs should display clearer when zooming in on iOS.</p>
        <h2>Account Administration</h2>
        <p>Administrators can now predefine a list of user accounts in a comma separated values (CSV) file for bulk import into Laserfiche Cloud. Previously, this option was only available for federated users.</p>
        <p>To prepare for future infrastructure enhancements, email addresses must now be unique for each user within a Laserfiche Cloud account.</p>
