        <p>The Laserfiche Cloud 2019.4 update, released on October 10, 2019, includes improved collaboration features.</p>

        <h2>Documents</h2>
        <h3>Co-authoring with Microsoft Office 365</h3>
        <p>Co-author Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint documents with multiple people using your Office 365 Business account. Changes can be made directly in your web browser, and will be automatically integrated and saved in the repository.</p>
        <h3>Laserfiche Vault</h3>
        <p>This release introduces Laserfiche Vault, an add-on to Cloud that enables strict compliance mode for records management.</p>
        <h3>OCR Language Support</h3>
        <p>Laserfiche Cloud automatically performs OCR on all documents scanned or imported into the repository. You can now set an OCR language for documents on a repository-wide basis or configure it directly on an individual document at the time of import. The OCR language set at the document level will take precedence over repository-wide settings, allowing you to easily support a repository with documents in multiple languages.</p>
        <h2>Process Automation</h2>
        <h3>Public Facing Forms in Process Automation</h3>
        <p>Collect information from public users with web forms to kick off internal processes in Process Automation. Public forms can be shared with users whether they are registered or not, allowing organizations to collect and act on responses from anyone. With public portal, you can turn this option on when viewing the <a href="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/docs/Default.htm#../Subsystems/ProcessAutomation/Content/Forms-Current/Public-Facing-Forms.htm" target="_parent" MadCap:conditions="Default.BlogOnly">process details for a business process</a>.</p>
        <h3>Integrations</h3>
        <p>Microsoft Dynamics has been added to the list of built-in CRM platform integrations, and provides access to standard objects in the Dynamics 365 Sales Hub through the Workflow "Perform CRM Action" activity. Data query rules now include options to Insert and Update data in data sources. Define Web Service Connections and Web Request Rules, for use with the Run Web Request Rule activity, to build integrations with external systems.</p>
