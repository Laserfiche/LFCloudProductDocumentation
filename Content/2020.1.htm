        <h1>New Features in Laserfiche Cloud 2020.1</h1>
        <p>The Laserfiche Cloud 2020.1 update, released on January 9, 2020, introduces new robotic process automation technology to the process automation platform and the option to directly share content in your Laserfiche repository.</p>
		<p>Watch an overview of the new features here:<iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/New-Features-Cloud-20201/New-Features-Cloud-20201_player.html"></iframe></p>
        <h2>Process Automation</h2>
        <h3>Workflow Bots</h3>
        <p>Bots, which use robotic process automation technology, let you easily configure software bots to automate repetitive clicks and keystrokes to seamlessly integrate multiple systems. Bots can copy and paste, fill out forms, read tables, codelessly integrate applications, and more, to help fill in automation gaps in processes.</p>
        <p>Use the bot recorder, which is downloaded and installed on your computer, to capture the series of actions the bot will perform. Then use the bot designer to edit and expand on those actions. When the bot runs, the Action History will track the bots progress.</p>
        <p>Bots can be invoked from a Workflow, started with a timer start event, or manually run from the Manage page. Additionally, a variety of metrics and details are collected letting you keep close tabs on how your bots are performing.</p>
        <h3>Workflow</h3>
        <p>You can now start a workflow from within a workflow using the new <b>Invoke Workflow</b> activity. Create a chain of events, or simplify workflow designs by creating task-specific workflows that can be started from a master workflow.</p>
        <h3>Capture Profiles</h3>
        <p>The Capture Profiles page now lets you filter by most recent, unpublished, and deleted profiles. You can also now view profile details such as who the profile was created by, when it was last modified, information being captured, and more.</p>
        <h3>Additional Process Automation Updates</h3>
        <p>Lookup Tables, a fast and easy-to-use replacement for Entities, are now available within the Data Management section of Process Automation. Upload and update tabular data for use throughout the Process Automation suite.</p>
        <p>Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM Custom Objects are now supported within the Integrations section, and accessible within a workflow via the Perform CRM Action activity.</p>
        <p>Business processes in Process Automation can now be accessed using the Laserfiche app.</p>
        <h2>Documents</h2>
        <h3>Direct Share</h3>
        <p>Laserfiche direct share allows you to share content from the Laserfiche repository with external users through the web client or mobile app. When you send documents through direct share, the recipient will receive a unique and anonymized URL that they can use to access the files for a limited period of time. You can add a password, and specify the number of days until the URL expires. The sender will receive notifications when the content was viewed, and they or a repository administrator can see the status of who shared it, with whom, and if and when it was accessed.</p>
        <h3>Search</h3>
        <p>The Laserfiche search interface has been updated to make it more streamlined and intuitive. Common search features can be accessed directly from the quick search bar, and a unified dropdown has made it easier to apply both built-in search filters and custom filters.</p>
