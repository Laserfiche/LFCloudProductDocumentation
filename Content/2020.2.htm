        <h1>New Features in Laserfiche Cloud 2020.2</h1>
        <p>The Laserfiche Cloud 2020.2 update, released on April 23, 2020, features the wide release of machine learning-assisted invoice capture, an updated layout designer when creating surveys, and more.</p>
        <p>Watch an overview of the new features here:</p><iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/New-Features-in-Cloud-20202\New-Features-in-Cloud-20202_player.html"></iframe>
        <h2>Process Automation</h2>
        <h3>Capture Profiles
        </h3>
        <p>The smart invoice capture profile, previously available for Solution Providers, is now available as an additional purchase to all Laserfiche Cloud customers. The smart invoice capture profile is a pre-configured profile that uses machine learning to automatically capture an invoice date, invoice number, purchase order number, and total amount due. Similar to custom capture profiles, the Run Capture Profile Workflow activity runs this smart profile and outputs tokens for the captured data to be used later in the workflow.</p>
        <h3>Surveys Layout Designer
        </h3>
        <p>Discover insights and new ideas to drive your organization forward. With an all new drag-and-drop designer, creating completely custom forms is easier than ever. Surveys powers your organization to create surveys, quizzes, and polls faster, and has easy-to-use analytics built-in to measure and understand the feedback.</p>
        <h3>Workflow Bots
        </h3>
        <p>You can now purchase additional bot workers and queues so that you can run multiple bots concurrently.</p>
        <h3>Ellucian Banner Integration (Solution Provider Preview)
        </h3>
        <p>Laserfiche is now an Ellucian Ethos Connected partner. Push and pull data between Laserfiche and Banner systems through Ellucian Ethos for more streamlined student forms processing in higher education institutions. Create a connection profile and configure the mapping between Laserfiche fields and Ellucian fields. Use the connection profile within a business process as part of a lookup rule to pre-populate form fields. You can also create a workflow to both query for information and update student information.</p>
