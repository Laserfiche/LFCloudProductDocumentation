        <h1>New Features in <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.LF Cloud" /> 2021.1</h1>
        <p>The  <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.LF Cloud" /> 2021.1 update, released on January 8, 2021, includes the following new features.</p>
        <p>Watch an overview of the new features here:</p>
        <p><iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/New-Features-in-Cloud-20211/New-Features-in-Cloud-20211_player.html"></iframe>
        </p>
        <h2><MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Process Automation" />
        </h2>
        <h3>Vendor Identification</h3>
        <p>With  <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Smart Invoice Capture" /> you can now retrieve vendor information from any invoice format. To use vendor identification, you'll need to first create a vendor lookup table. This table can be easily created by exporting an <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Excel" /> or <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.CSV" /> file from your financial software, and importing it to Data Management in <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Process Automation" />. Then, using <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Workflow" />'s Run Capture Profile activity, select the Enable vendor identification option to have workflow dynamically retrieve vendor data. In addition to retrieving standard invoice data, you can use this feature to retrieve custom values from the lookup table. This lets you automate GL coding and capture payment terms based on vendor.</p>
        <h3><MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Workflow" /> and Rules</h3>
        <p>With the new Document Merge rule type, you can assign parameter names to fields in a fillable <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.PDF" /> form. Once a <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.PDF" /> has been configured with parameters, it can be accessed and filled by other processes. To automatically fill the <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.PDF" /> form, access the Document Merge rule in the <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Workflow" /> Run Rule activity to populate the form data from tokens.</p>
        <h3>Business Processes</h3>
        <p>New features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A new Business Process Service Task that allows a business process to be started from a business process, similar to the <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Workflow" /> Service Task.</li>
            <li>Variable Management has moved to the main process designer left navigation, and is no longer only accessible from within the forms designer. Variables can now be modified and delete, and are automatically updated or removed from the entire process when changed.</li>
            <li>Business process can now be started from a workflow.</li>
            <li>The Process Promotion tool helps you migrate <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.LF Forms" /> processes from one environment onto another. The tool prompts you to update any information from the original environment to the other. This allows existing processes to be updated in a development environment and then migrated to the production environment more smoothly.</li>
            <li>If there is an error during submission of a user form, the form data is retained to allow the user to remedy the error, and repopulate the form before attempting to submit.</li>
            <li>The Save to Repository Service Task has been enhanced to use folder IDs within the repository.</li>
            <li>Additional features have been added to the modern form designer, bringing more functionality similar to the classic designer.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Documents</h2>
        <h3>Repository Search Bar Improvements</h3>
        <p>The repository search bar has been updated to make it easier to run and manage your saved searches, re-run recent searches, and apply custom search filters.</p>
        <h2><MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Laserfiche" /> API Preview</h2>
