        </p>
        <h2>Project Security</h2>
        <p>Support security requirements and citizen developer efforts with project security. By grouping your business processes, rules, lookup tables, and other process automation resources into projects, you can apply a wide variety of security roles to allow for granular control over access. For example, you can grant access to external developers to allow them to build and edit resources but not see any data collected. Then grant team members access to see the data collected by business processes, but not the ability to edit the actual process.</p>
        <h2>Form Field Rules</h2>
        <p>More flexibly design custom, no-code forms with built-in field rule options to conditionally show or require fields based on complex AND/OR criteria. For example, you can now validate content via field rules, control the visibility of pagination and action buttons, and configure rules depending on process step or stage. You can also create dynamic conditions to compare field values. For instance, you could verify that an end date is not set before a selected start date. Additionally, complex conditions allow for advanced criteria selections through grouping conditions.</p>
        <h2>Capture Profile Updates</h2>
        <p>The Capture Profile Designer user interface has been updated to be more intuitive for users. To match the rest of Process Automation, arrows are now used to add or remove profiles from groups. Users will also now see a "Draft" label next to profiles and profile groups that are not published.</p>
        <h2>Direct Share</h2>
        <p>Users can now share entire folders with external parties using direct share. When sharing a folder, the folder’s contents—including all subfolders—will be combined in a single ZIP file for download. Audit Trail will also reflect each document that was shared in the folder.</p>
        <h2>New Solution Templates</h2>
        <p>Accelerate solution deployment with new and updated prebuilt templates including a Building Permit &amp; Inspection template and a Student COVID-19 Vaccination Records Request template.</p>
