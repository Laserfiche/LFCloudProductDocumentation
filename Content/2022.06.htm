        </p>
        <h2>Transcription</h2>
        <p>Laserfiche now allows you to search within the audio content of media files. When an audio or video file is imported into Laserfiche, it will be automatically transcribed. The resulting transcription can then be searched like any other document with associated text. Context hits allow users to jump directly to the relevant part of the media file, and they can also view the text side-by-side with the file. Video and audio files imported on or after June 9, 2022 will automatically be transcribed. Media files that were imported before that date need to be manually transcribed to become searchable or to be viewed alongside the video.</p>
        <h2>Laserfiche API Client Libraries</h2>
        <p>Access the Laserfiche API using <a href="https://developer.laserfiche.com/libraries.html">new client libraries</a>. TypeScript/JavaScript and .NET client library packages for OAuth authentication and working with a Laserfiche Cloud repository are available through the npm registry and the NuGet gallery. The libraries are open source and the implementations and sample projects are available on GitHub.</p>
        <h2>Submit Your Own Solution</h2>
        <p><a href="https://marketplace.laserfiche.com/">New solution templates</a> include processes for collecting information related to the federal assistance program as well as an invoice review and payment solution that makes use of smart invoice capture.</p>
        <p>You can now <a href="https://portal.laserfiche.com/w6303/forms/SolutionTemplateSubmission">contribute to the Solution Marketplace</a> by submitting your own solutions.

        <h2>Expansion of Integrations Activities</h2>
