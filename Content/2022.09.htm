        <h2>Business Processes</h2>
        <p>A variety of updates to business processes improve security, form signatures, and emails.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When using the signature field in a form, a new option lets users save their signature so they can apply the same signature to future forms. You can turn this option on when configuring the Signature field in the Form designer.</li>
            <li>You can now require email address confirmation when saving a draft of a form. This helps ensure that email addresses are correct.</li>
            <li>Email size limits have been increased.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Process Automation Security Updates</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
               Process administrators can now use project security to secure the access and edit rights for web requests.
</li>
            <li>A new security feature lets you hide step history information from users who do not need to see the actions that others may take. Steps can be hidden at the start event and activity level, or at the overall process level.            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Workflow Updates</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>An updated workflow import process now allows you to map each referenced capture profile to a capture profile in the new environment. The import process also has an improved flow for configuring these mappings.</li>
            <li>Email size limits have been increased.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Solution Marketplace</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Community-submitted solution templates that were originally only available for self-hosted Laserfiche implementations are now available in Laserfiche Cloud. These templates let you:                <blockquote><ul><li>
                           Create a Laserfiche resource navigation page
                        </li><li>

            <li>
                The Solution Marketplace has been updated with icons to show the organization that submitted the solution. Laserfiche-created solutions have an icon showing the solution’s category.
