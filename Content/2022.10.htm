        <h2>Layout Designer Enhancements</h2>
        <p>Conditionally apply validation to fields depending on values set in other fields. For example, you can configure validation to guide users to choose an end date that is after the start date they set in a previous field.</p>
        <p>You can add labels to form table rows to help guide users through filling out tables.</p>
        <p>On submitted forms, uploaded images and PDFs are easier to preview with a new eye icon next to the image. From the preview window you can zoom in on the image and review it without having to download it.</p>
