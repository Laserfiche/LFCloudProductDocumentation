        <h2>Elevated Developer Role</h2>
        <p>Users with the Team Developer role who have Process Automation access can now develop within a team’s projects. Previously users would need an account-wide Process Automation Developer role in order to do so. This update lets users develop within a project without being able to see Global items.</p>
        <h2>Global Resource Sharing Control Updates</h2>
        <p>A project listing page is now available under the Teams section in Process Automation which allows Process Administrators to manage what Global resources projects may have access to as well as see all projects that are within their Laserfiche system.</p>
        <h2>Layout Designer Updates</h2>
        <p>More methods have been added to the <a href="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/en-us/Default.htm#../Subsystems/ProcessAutomation/Content/Forms-Current/Javascript-and-CSS/TheLFFormObject.htm" target="_parent">LFForm object</a> to allow changing field settings, form settings, field rules, and adding rows and sets to tables and collections. Additionally, two events have been added for lookup trigger and lookup done.</p>
        <p>When there are fields on the form with duplicate names, sometimes it is not clear which field is associated with a field ID or variable name. Now when you are in the rules tab, the info tag for each field appears.</p>
        <h2>Account ID Added to Laserfiche URLs</h2>
        <p>Laserfiche URLs created from tasks in business processes or from the <b>Copy URL</b> option in the repository now include the account ID. That means when a Laserfiche user clicks these URLs, the account number auto-populates on the Laserfiche sign-in page for a smoother user experience.</p>
        <h2>New Solution Templates</h2>
        <p>New solution templates include a sample integration with Google Cloud’s Sentiment Analysis API, a network access request, and an early identification of mental illness process.</p>
