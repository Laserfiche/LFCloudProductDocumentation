Our Connector is built on top of the Laserfiche API, so you can connect both Laserfiche self-hosted and cloud systems, making it easy to view, save, update, and download Laserfiche documents and metadata all from another application. In addition, Laserfiche business processes can connect and share documents and metadata into the Boomi platform, extending the power of Laserfiche process automation across the entire organization.

Process designers can select additional display names when configuring the email services or user task.</p>
        <h2>OAuth 2.0 Scope Support </h2>
        <p>OAuth 2.0 scope support has been added for additional security when using the Laserfiche APIs. Scopes allow administrators to indicate what rights can be performed by someone using this connection.

        <h2>Laserfiche Developer Console Update</h2>
