        </p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude">Expanded Regional Settings Support</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude">Laserfiche Cloud has introduced new regional settings enhancements, including improved translations for Spanish and French, as well as the ability for administrators to control regional settings such as language, time zone, and date formats across their organization. These features have been released for the sign-in page, the app picker, the repository, public portal, the tasks inbox, forms submissions, and process reports, and will be expanded to administrative portions of Laserfiche Cloud in the future.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude">Administrators can set a default language and region for their organization in the Settings section of the Account Administration page. In addition, users can configure their own language and region settings in My Account.</p>
        <h2> MuleSoft Partnership</h2>
        <p>We continue to expand our iPaaS (integration Platform as a Service) support through a new strategic partnership with MuleSoft, a Salesforce company. This new partnership provides even more integration options for Laserfiche customers by exposing hundreds of application connectors within the MuleSoft platform. Our Laserfiche Connector for MuleSoft allows you to easily integrate your Cloud or self-hosted Laserfiche instance with popular enterprise applications, making it easy to view, save, update, and download Laserfiche documents and metadata across your entire organization. Explore the Laserfiche Solution Marketplace today to learn more about the platform connectors available.</p>
        <h2>Form Layout Designer Updates</h2>
        <p>The layout designer has been updated to provide validation for all field properties in the Form designer. If a form creator enters an invalid value for a property, for example, a maximum range that is less than the minimum range, they will be alerted.</p>
        <p>A new option lets the form designer configure the field size for file upload. This feature is helpful when adding a file upload field to a table so the button fits nicely within the table.</p>
        <p>You now have the ability to customize theme elements for pagination options. You can also convert pagination themes from the classic form designer to the new designer.</p>
        <p>A new JavaScript API lets you add or remove CSS classes.</p>
        <h2>Process Promotion Updates</h2>
        <p>The email display name option has been added to the process promotion tool. You can create or select new email display names when importing a business process into a target environment along with other unmatched resources such as users, teams, workflows, rules, and more.</p>
        <h2>API Updates</h2>
        <p>The Java libraries for interacting with the Laserfiche API from Java applications has been improved with a version 2 release that includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>New functions for exporting documents to a stream</li>
            <li>Automatically refreshing expired access tokens</li>
            <li>Improved error handling and retry on transient errors</li>
            <li>Function parameter classes to improve code readability, and</li>
            <li>Async APIs replaced with blocking APIs </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The libraries are open source and the implementations and sample projects are available on <a href="https://github.com/Laserfiche" target="_parent">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <h2>Direct Share Updates</h2>
        <p>Direct share has been updated so that you can increase the time period to share documents from 7 to 30 days for Business tier Cloud, Self-hosted Subscription, and Laserfiche Rio.</p>
        <p>You can also increase the maximum file size from 200MB to 1GB or more based on your pricing plan.</p>
        <h2>DocuSign and Laser App Accounts</h2>
        <p>The DocuSign and Laser App integrations will now use the “DocuSignUser” and “LaserAppUser” accounts when accessing the repository, allowing you to more finely control what content the integrations have access to.</p>
        <h2>Capture Profiles Updates</h2>
        <p>When opening a capture profile that was created using a previous OCR engine, a new dialog will automatically update the existing sample pages to have more accurate text and match the results you see at runtime.</p>
        <h2>New Solution Templates</h2>
        <p>New solution templates include an employee annual review process, which allows managers to schedule staff performance reviews with automated reminders, and a flexible contract management system, which is designed to meet more flexible needs than our standard Contract Management System template and our customer-contributed Contract Approval Process template.</p>
