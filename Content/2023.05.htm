        <h2> Business Process Updates</h2>
        <p>You can now add more action buttons to your forms besides the standard Submit, Approve, and Reject buttons. Then you can route your forms based on whatever action button was selected.</p>
        <p>With action history now included in email notifications, users can have more context before processing tasks, especially when directly approving via email. You can include action history as PDF attachment in a user task notification, reminder, and/or email service task.</p>
        <h2>Layout Designer Updates</h2>
        <p>There are two new ways to modify your form’s design with field rules. You can now add or remove CSS classes from fields, and you can also control the default comment box behavior with field rules.</p>
        <p>Your CSS is also now easier to navigate to with a new button on the form’s toolbar that will open the designer to the CSS tab within the Theme section.</p>
        <p>Designers can control the allowed input types for Laserfiche signatures by toggling between using a typed signature, drawn signature, or either signature type.</p>
        <h2>Web Client Updates</h2>
        <p>Smoother link sharing across repositories is now available. All URL links to folders or documents inside a repository will now automatically fill in the account ID for recipients, matching the behavior of our previously released Copy URL feature.</p>
        <h2>IPaaS Updates</h2>
