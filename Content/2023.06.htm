        <h2> Expanded Regional Settings Support</h2>
        <p>Laserfiche Cloud has introduced new regional settings enhancements, including improved translations for Spanish and French, as well as the ability for administrators to control regional settings such as language, time zone, and date formats across their organization. These features have been released for the sign-in page, the app picker, the repository, public portal, direct share, the tasks inbox, forms submissions, and process reports, and will be expanded to administrative and process designer portions of Laserfiche Cloud in the future.</p>
        <p>Administrators can set a default language and region for their organization in the Settings section of the Account Administration page. In addition, users can configure their own language and region settings in My Account. </p>
        <h2>Public Portal Update</h2>
        <p>Public Portal now follows your account-configured repository display name so that the repository name is displayed in a more friendly and understandable way.</p>
        <h2>Web Client Updates</h2>
        <p>URLs stored in text metadata fields will now be clickable, allowing users to easily navigate to linked pages directly.</p>
        <p>The web client will now support streaming MKV files for Chrome &amp; Edge. MKV files are a popular all-in-one media container that allows picture, audio, subtitle tracks, and image data to all be stored within a single file. </p>
        <h2>In-app Feedback Update</h2>
        <p>The In App Feedback tool, where Laserfiche users can share product feedback and suggestions, now supports the ability to attach files or images with feedback. This enables users to upload things like screenshots that help explain their comments, and enables the Laserfiche Product team to more clearly understand their intentions.</p>
        <h2>New Solution Templates</h2>
        <p>A new solution template, CSS/JavaScript/Formula Examples v2, is a collection of general CSS, JavaScript, and formula examples you can apply to customize your classic designer forms. To view the respective code or formula used for each example, click the “Show Code” button.</p>
