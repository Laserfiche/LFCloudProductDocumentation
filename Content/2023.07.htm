        <p><iframe width="100%" height="650" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/New-Features-in-Cloud-July-2023/New-Features-in-Cloud-July-2023_player.html"></iframe>
        </p>
        <h2>Smart Invoice Capture</h2>
        <p>Smart Invoice Capture now automates the extraction of four additional fields from invoices: the shipping address, subtotal, tax amount, and tax ID. This will increase your ability to drive Accounts Payable processing based on this metadata without having to configure manual zones.</p>
        <h2>Laserfiche App</h2>
        <p>Biometric support for signing into Laserfiche Cloud has been updated to include Azure AD and AD FS. You can use Face ID (for iOS) or fingerprint scanning (for iOS and Android) to securely remember user sign-in information when authenticating through Azure AD, AD FS, or with a Laserfiche username and password.</p>
        <h2>Web Request Rules</h2>
        <p>The Web Service Connections used by web request rules now support the industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocol. This enhancement enables greater and more secure access to 3rd party applications and APIs from Laserfiche while making it simpler to design. Additionally, custom headers can now be added directly to the Web Service Connections definition for improved security and management of your request data from connected Web Request Rules.</p>
        <h2>New Solution Templates</h2>
        <p>New solution templates include a box retrieval request process, which allows organizations to manage requests to retrieve boxes of records from offsite storage, and a preschool application process, which allow students to apply for preschool services, with review steps and email notifications. This process includes an option for automatic translation of the form using Google Translate embedded within the interface.</p>
