        <h2> Expanded Regional Settings Support</h2>
        <p>Laserfiche has expanded Spanish and French language support to all aspects of the Laserfiche suite, specifically those areas focused on designer and administrator roles.</p>
        <p>Administrators can set a default language and region for their organization in the Settings section of the Account Administration page. In addition, users can configure their own language and region settings in My Account.</p>
        <h2>Forms Reporting Update</h2>
        <p>Search has been enhanced in Forms Reporting. A new 'All Versions' option lets you search for all data for a process instead of just data related to a specific version of a process. When searching by version, more version information is now available, such as the version’s publish date and current running instances.</p>
        <h2>Workflow Update</h2>
        <p>Using the Search Repository activity, Workflow now lets you search for an empty metadata field. This lets you quickly identify fields with missing metadata and use Workflow to automatically fill out those fields.</p>
        <h2>Layout Designer Updates</h2>
        <p>Field masks help users filling out forms to enter data in the correct format. For example, a field mask can ensure that a telephone number is formatted with the area code in parentheses and with a dash between the third and fourth numbers.</p>
        <p>For example, a field mask can ensure a telephone number is formatted with a dash after the first set of three numbers and a dash after the second set of three numbers.</p>
        <p>For example, a field mask can ensure an employee ID number is formatted with three letters a dash and then four numbers.</p>
        <p>Expanding on table and collection field search, a new option lets you filter tables and collections to more easily find information in large tables or collections. The filter includes condition logic to fine tune your results.</p>
        <h2>Import Agent and Email Archive 11</h2>
        <p>Import Agent and Email Archive have been updated with features, performance enhancements, quality of life improvements, new options for generating Laserfiche pages from PDFs, and more.</p>

        <h2>Solution Templates</h2>
