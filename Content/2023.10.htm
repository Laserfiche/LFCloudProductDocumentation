        <p><iframe width="100%" height="650" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/New-Features-In-Cloud-202310/New-Features-In-Cloud-202310_player.html"></iframe>
        </p>
        <h2>New Process Automation Capabilities</h2>
        <p>When designing a form, you can now customize the sub fields within an address field. For example, you could change the “Address Line 2” label to say “Apt., Unit, etc. (optional)” or remove the “Country” sub-field.</p>
        <p>In Email Service Tasks, send an email to each member of an entire team at once by entering the team in the Send to field. For even more flexibility, you can dynamically email different teams by using a variable in this field that resolves to the name of a team.</p>
        <p>In Workflow, the Search Repository activity can now search for documents with a specific tag applied to them. This provides yet another option for finding documents for Workflow to interact with. Additionally, the Set Records Management Properties activity can now automate the uncutoff action on records.</p>
        <p>When configuring a lookup query rule, you can configure the maximum number of rows to return. This allows for better process performance for processes or forms using the rule.</p>
        <h2>Process Design Usability Enhancements</h2>
        <p>When editing a form or a business process, use the Manage rules link to go directly to the rules management page, allowing you to quickly navigate between where you are using the rule and the rule itself. If you create new rules or modify existing rules, you can then refresh the rule dropdown list directly to let your process or form use the updated rules.</p>
        <p>When editing forms that contain a large number of fields, you can quickly find the field you want to edit by searching by the field name, variable name, or field ID. Click a search result to go directly to the field. Additionally, click the field rules link to directly open the field rules associated with that field.</p>
        <p>It's also now easier to monitor running and completed workflows with new tooltips and it’s easier to see the total number of selected list items.</p>
        <h2>Form Scripting Updates</h2>
        <p>Designers can now bind to HTML events within custom HTML fields to run functions in the layout designer JavaScript sandbox. For example, create a custom button in one custom HTML field that starts a timer that is displayed in another custom HTML field.</p>
        <p>The LFForm object can update more field settings such as address subfields, submission action buttons, pagination titles, previous and next buttons, signature and file upload button labels, and table column field settings. This gives you full control over all the labels in your form.</p>
        <h2>API Updates</h2>
        <p>The Repository Cloud API version 2 release brings new API functionalities such as large file upload, standardized long operation APIs, and many developer ergonomics improvements. A corresponding JavaScript API client library has also been released to make it easier for JavaScript developers to integrate with the Laserfiche repository.</p>
        <h2>Solution Templates</h2>
        <p>A variety of new solutions automate scanning, capture, and invoice processing with EzeScan. Additionally, a new solution streamlines department requests and tasks in Microsoft Planner.</p>
