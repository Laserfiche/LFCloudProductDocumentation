        <p><iframe width="100%" height="650" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/New-Features-in-Cloud-202311/New-Features-in-Cloud-202311_player.html"></iframe>
        </p>
        <h2>Lookup Table Updates</h2>
        <p>Laserfiche Cloud now supports increased row and table limits for lookup tables to better support enterprise data set storage. See the <a href="service/Service-Limits.htm">service limits</a> for additional details.</p>
        <h2>Form Designer Updates</h2>
        <p>You can now configure field rules to run based on where the form is in a process. For example, you can configure specific fields to be shown only when the form is saved to the repository, which allows you to have more control over what is seen when viewing the form.</p>
        <p>You now have more control over how forms are saved to the repository. For multi-page forms, a new option creates corresponding page breaks in the forms when they are saved as PDFs. </p>
        <h2>Direct Share One-Time Passcode</h2>
        <p>Direct Share has streamlined security by allowing you to automatically generate a one-time passcode for content recipients, instead of having to create and share a password with them manually. The use of an integrated one-time passcode makes sharing content both more secure and easier, as the sender no longer has to additionally communicate password information to the recipient. Instead, it's all built-in directly at the time of accessing the shared content.</p>
        <p>You may also combine this one-time passcode with the option to manually generate a password for a multi-factor authentication (or MFA) experience where needed.</p>
        <h2>SharePoint Online Integration Updates</h2>
        <p>The new Laserfiche SharePoint Online Integration lets you take advantage of Laserfiche’s security and records management functionality in an integration with SharePoint Online. The integration provides a way to browse your Laserfiche repository, view documents, and save documents to Laserfiche with configurable metadata mapping directly from SharePoint Online. Add the integration to your SharePoint Online site from the Microsoft Marketplace.</p>
        <h2>Solution Marketplace Updates</h2>
        <p>See a new solution template for a process that allows for constituents and visitors to the city to report instances of acts of discrimination. Additionally, see a partner-provided NEOGOV integration with Laserfiche.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in sharing your solutions with the wider Laserfiche community, please visit the <a href="https://marketplace.laserfiche.com/home" target="_parent">Laserfiche Solution Marketplace</a> and follow the <b>Submit a Solution</b> link at the top of the page.</p>
