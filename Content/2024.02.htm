        <h2>Capture Enhancements</h2>
        <p>Capture Profile zones will now return a blank value when a zone's anchor is not found on the page, rather than capturing the text at the zone’s location. This behavior matches the expectation that if a field is not part of a document, its value will be blank. It also allows Workflow to respond to blank vs filled fields and process documents accordingly.</p>
        <h2>New Solution Templates</h2>
        <p>New solution templates include an example of a multi-step quiz and a workflow that can replace a Lookup Table's content with data from a spreadsheet.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the new Point Submission &amp; Redemption solution lets you efficiently administer a rewards program – e.g. a Customer Champions initiative – in which users can earn points for performing specified activities and then later redeem accumulated points for prizes.</p>
