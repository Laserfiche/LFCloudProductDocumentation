        <h2>Introducing Native Support for Web Requests in Forms</h2>
        <p>Form Lookup Rules now support Web Request rules from both the form designer and classic form designer. Previously users had to use lookup tables and queries to integrate data with their forms, or they had to implement their own JavaScript to integrate with web APIs. Native access to web request rules in forms lets designers easily integrate 3rd party data sources using potentially complex APIs, including the Laserfiche API. These web request rules are now secured by Laserfiche and the underlying authentication credentials are not exposed to the user like they would be when executed through custom JavaScript.</p>
        <h2>New Solution Templates</h2>
        <p>The new Automated Document Downloader solution includes the tools needed to create a workflow-based export of a document from the Laserfiche Cloud repository and have it downloaded to a local file share. Additionally, the Send Calendar Event with Microsoft Outlook / Graph Integration solution integrates with Microsoft Outlook calendar to send calendar invites as part of a Laserfiche process.</p>
        <p>Lastly, a Timed Test solution creatively uses custom JavaScript to provide a visual display of time remaining on a test.</p>
