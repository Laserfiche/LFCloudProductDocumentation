        <h2>Introducing Laserfiche AI Document Summarization</h2>
        <p>The release of this feature is the next step in Laserfiche’s transformative journey to harness the power of generative AI for customer productivity. When working with documents in the repository, users may want to quickly understand the contents of a document without needing to open and read it in detail.</p>
        <p>Document summarization, powered by Laserfiche AI, helps to reduce or eliminate tedious sifting through documents in your repository to find relevant information. You can now generate a concise summary of a document when browsing in the folder browser or when viewing documents in the document viewer. Once a document is selected, users can click the summary button, located in the details pane, to generate a summary. After a summary is generated, it can then be deleted, copied, or regenerated using the available buttons. With a single click you can also copy and share the summary directly into an email, or copy the summary with the URL.</p>
        <p>Document summarization is supported for virtually any document containing text or transcribed audio. This means imaged documents, PDFs, Office documents, and audio and video files are eligible for summarization.</p>
