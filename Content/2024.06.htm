        <h2>Account Administration Bulk Action Enhancements</h2>
        <p> We've made it even easier to manage users in bulk with improvements to account administration settings such as: Enable, Disable, Delete, Add to group, Set user license type, and Require password change, all from one interface. In addition, enhancements to the user experience now include pop-up dialogs, delivering progress updates and displaying results within the interface seamlessly. Adding users to groups has been enhanced with group search when adding users to a group, and the Assign Rights dialog now supports selecting up to 50 users at a time, streamlining user management, along with new action confirmations that minimize the risk of unintended changes.</p>
        <h2>Updated Process Automation Starting Event Option</h2>
        <p>We've updated the Process Automation Starting Event options to be clearer and default appropriately. You may have workflows or business processes that change documents in your repository. Starting event options that use a workflow or business process to satisfy starting event conditions on another workflow now defaults to off in order to avoid runaway workflows, and must be manually enabled as needed.</p>
        <h2>Additional Changes</h2>
        <p>Please see the <a href="service/changelog.htm">recent changes page</a> for a listing of additional fixes and changes.</p>
