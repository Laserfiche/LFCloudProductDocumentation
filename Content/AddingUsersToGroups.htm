        <h1>Adding Users To A&#160;Group</h1>
        <p>There are multiple methods of adding users to a preexisting group. </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: To create a new group, navigate to the <a href="CreatingGroups.htm">Creating a Group</a>.</p>
        <h2><a name="Add"></a>Add Users by Clicking +&#160;Add to Group Button </h2>

              <p><img src="Images/MembersAddedBanner.png" border="1" /> </p><p> If you do not see the green banner, repeat the steps in the <a href="#Add">Add Users by Clicking +&#160;Add to Group Button</a> section or use the <b>Edit Group</b> page in <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Account Administration (LF)" /> to add users as shown in <a href="EditingAGroup.htm">Editing a Group</a>.</p></li>
            <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> To modify or assign rights to users in a group, navigate to <b>Security and Access</b> section in the <a href="CreatingGroups.htm">Creating a Group</a> page. </p>
            <p class="note"><b>Tip:</b> Assign rights at the group level as much as possible. Access rights can be set on either individual users or on groups, but setting rights on groups and allowing the users within the groups to inherit those rights will result in needing fewer manual configuration to accomplish the same purpose, and therefore will be easier to troubleshoot and less prone to error in the future. In general, the more manual configurations you need to accomplish something, the greater overhead for administration in the future. </p>
        </ol>
