        <h1>Search&#160;Filters</h1>
        <p>Search&#160;filters allow you to create detailed searches that will locate entries based on the specific search filters. </p>
        <p>When performing a search using a search filter, you can select exactly which criteria you want to search on. If you search on multiple criteria, documents will only be returned if they meet all the criteria. </p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Performing a Search Using Search Filters</h2>
        <p>To perform a search using search filters, click <b>Search&#160;Filters</b> next to the search bar at the top of the Folder Browser. The <b>Search&#160;Filters</b> pane will appear. The most common search filters will be listed by default, and you can click <b>Add Filter</b> to select additional searches. To add a Records Management search filter, click on <b>Add Filter</b> and then  select the Records Management search filter you want to add. Fill in the search terms you want to search on and click <b>Search</b>, or click <b>Reset</b> to clear the search filters dialog box.</p>
        <p class="ex"><b>Tip:</b>&#160;If you want to see the <a href="Search_Syntax.htm">search syntax</a> of the search you are performing, you can select the <b>More Actions</b> button and then select <b>View Search Syntax</b>. This is a useful way to learn how to create a search syntax search. You can also copy the syntax from this box and paste it into the <b>Search syntax</b> search option, and then fine-tune it without having to write the syntax from scratch.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Search&#160;Filter Types</h2>
        <p>The following search filters are available in the <b>Search Filters</b> pane. (See <a href="#Records">Records Management search filters</a>, below, for information about Records Management searches.)</p>
        <h3>Annotation</h3>
        <p>The <b>Annotation</b> search filter allows you to search for documents that contain a particular search term in the <b>Stamp name</b>, <b>Callout text</b>, <b>Sticky note</b> text, <b>Text box</b> text, or in the <b>Comment</b> of any annotation type. </p>
        <h3>Date</h3>

There are three ways to use the Template search filter:&#160;you can specify a template and search for all documents or folders with that template, you can specify a template and provide field values and search for all documents or folders with that template and with those field values, or you can specify one or more fields without specifying a template and search for documents or folders that contain the provided field values, regardless of template.</p>
        <p>To search for all documents with a particular template, open the <b>Choose template</b> drop-down menu and select a template. Documents with that template will be returned, regardless of their field values.</p>
        <p>To search for documents with a particular template and a particular field value or values, open the <b>Choose template</b> drop-down menu and select a template, then fill in search terms in one or more field in that template. Documents with that template and those particular field values will be returned.</p>
