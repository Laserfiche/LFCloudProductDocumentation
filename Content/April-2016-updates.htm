            <MadCap:concept term="Laserfiche Cloud" />April 2016 Update for <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.LF Cloud" /></h1>
        <p>The April 2016 update of <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.LF Cloud" /> adds expanded options when creating and downloading documents, additional search options, and more ways to customize window pane layout.</p>
        <p>You can watch an overview of the new features here:</p><iframe width="100%" height="557" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/New-Features-in-Laserfiche-Cloud-April-2016/New-Features-in-Laserfiche-Cloud-April-2016.html"></iframe>
        <h2>Import Profiles</h2>
        <p>In many cases, users need to frequently import documents of consistent types. For example, a user in the HR department might need to frequently import resumes and applications for prospective employees, as well as tax or insurance information for existing employees. With the April 2016 update, users can streamline this process by setting up import profiles for commonly-imported document types.</p>
        <p>An import profile allows you to configure a default name, folder path, and template for imported documents of a particular type. Then, when importing a document, you can select the import profile from the list, rather than manually selecting the appropriate path, template, and so forth. The HR employee in the example above might set up one import profile for “Applications and Resumes” and another for “Tax Information.” You can also extract information from the file name and use it to dynamically create the document name or path. For instance, if application file names always contain the applicant’s name, you could extract that section of the file name and use it to automatically store the document in a folder named for the applicant.</p>
        <h2>Improved <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Microsoft Outlook" /> Import</h2>
        <p>You can now drag and drop emails directly from <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Outlook (Microsoft)" /> into <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Laserfiche" />. You can also use the <b>Save to <i>Open Folder</i></b> button in the <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Laserfiche" /> ribbon to save emails to the folder you currently have open in <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Laserfiche" />, or the <b>Save to Default Folder</b> button to save them to the default folder you have configured in <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Repository (LF&#160;Repo)" /> Administration.</p>
        <h2>Download Documents in a ZIP&#160;File</h2>
        <p>You now have the option to download multiple documents as a ZIP file. The option to download a <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Laserfiche" /> briefcase (LFB) file is still available.</p>
        <h2>Template-Specific Required Fields</h2>
        <p>Previously, required fields existed solely as an attribute of the field: if a field was marked as required, then it would be required in all templates to which it belonged. However, in some cases, users wanted to be able to mark a field as required in one template, but not in another. For example, an “Employee Name” field might be required on an “HR” template, where it is a critical piece of information, but optional on a “Reports” template, where there might or might not be an employee associated with the report. You can now mark fields as required on a template-by-template basis, in addition to the already-present global required field property.</p>
        <h2>Recycle Bin Search</h2>
        <p>You can now perform searches for documents in the recycle bin, allowing you to easily locate deleted documents. You can search on many of the properties of the deleted document, including document name, fields, and tags. All users can search for documents they themselves deleted, and users with the Manage Entry Access privilege can search across all documents in the recycle bin. This is especially useful for administrators, who may need to locate an accidentally-deleted document, or identify which documents contain a particular metadata type.</p>
        <h2>Additional Display Options</h2>
        <p>Configure the details pane to show only the tabs that you are interested in. In addition, you can now resize both the folder pane and details pane.</p>
