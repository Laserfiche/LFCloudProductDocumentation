        <h1>Auditing</h1>
        <p>Auditing enables you to track activities performed in a <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Laserfiche Repository" />. The tracked information is used to generate reports. Combined 
 with other aspects of the <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.LF Account Administration" /> system, auditing not only helps to 
 show compliance with legal regulations, but also contributes to the security 
 of the <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Laserfiche Repository" />.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Laserfiche" /> auditing gives you fine-grain 
 control over how auditing options are configured, allowing you to audit by user or group and audit both successful and failed attempts to perform an action. 
 You can also specify that certain types of actions (such as document deletion or export)&#160;will require users to provide a reason. Once you have selected events to audit, you can view, filter, and export audit information in Audit Reports. You can create reports to analyze audit data, view the information as a chart, filter it to include only the information relevant to you, and export the data for use in spreadsheet programs such as <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Microsoft Excel" />. </p>
        <p>Auditing is <a href="Configuring_Auditing.htm">configured</a> in Repository Administration. <a href="Audit_Reports.htm">Audit reporting</a> is performed under Audit Trail.</p>
        <p>Laserfiche Cloud/subscription offers three tiers and each tier offers different Audit Trail features:  </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Starter:</b> Starter lets a privileged user configure which events will be logged for a particular repository. Auditing is performed on all users. No users are exempt, regardless of the privileges, feature rights, or access rights that have been granted.</li>
            <li><b>Professional:</b> Professional includes Starter Audit Trail features, but has the ability to upgrade to Advanced Audit Trail.</li>
            <li><b>Business:</b> Business includes Advanced Audit Trail, which offers fine-grain control over how auditing options are configured, allowing you to audit by user or group and audit both successful and failed attempts to perform an action. Advanced Audit also determines if reasons for performing certain events will be required.</li>
        </ul>
