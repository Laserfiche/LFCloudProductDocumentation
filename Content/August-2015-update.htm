        <h1>
            <MadCap:concept term="Laserfiche Cloud" />August 2015 Update for <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.LF Cloud" /></h1>
        <p>The August 2015 update of <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.LF Cloud" /> includes many new features, as well as updates to existing features. These include the ability to import directly from <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Google Drive" />, <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.OneDrive" />, or <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.OneDrive" /> for Business, several new enhancements to columns, and a new document preview pane in the Folder Browser.</p>
        <p>You can watch an overview of the new features here:</p><iframe width="100%" height="557" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/August-2015-Update/Whats-New-In-Laserfiche-Cloud-August-2015.html"></iframe>
        <h2>Import from <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Google Drive" />, <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.OneDrive" />, or <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.OneDrive" />for Business</h2>
        <p>You can now import documents from <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Google Drive" />, <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.OneDrive" />, or <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.OneDrive" /> for Business directly into <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Laserfiche" />. This allows you to quickly capture and centrally store all your content, without needing to first export it first. Administrators can choose to enable import from any or all of these services by opening <b>Repository Administration</b>, selecting Integrations, and then selecting the  <b>Import Services</b> tab. Once they have done so, users will be provided with the option to import from the relevant cloud import service when they click the Import button  (<img src="Resources/Images/import_button.png" />).</p>
        <h2>Enhancements to Columns</h2>
        <p>Columns allow you to quickly view information about documents and locate the correct document within the Folder Browser. You can now use columns in two new ways:&#160;saving column profiles to quickly modify the information you want to display, and sorting by multiple columns.</p>
        <h3>Column Profiles</h3>
        <p>A column profile is a collection of columns that you can save and then quickly apply to the Folder Browser. For instance, in some situations, you may want to view the user who created the document, the creation date, and the last modified date, while in other situations you might want to view template field information about the document. Displaying all this information at once may make it difficult to view, as you would have to scroll to see all the columns. With column profiles, you can easily switch between these two views.</p>
        <p>To create a column profile, click <b>Display Options</b> in the Folder Browser and select <b>Column Picker</b>, then select the columns you want to include in this column profile. You can also drag and drop to reorder them. Once you have the columns selected, click <b>Save Profile</b>. You will be prompted to specify a name for this profile. Repeat to create as many column profiles as you want. You can then right-click the column bar and point to <b>Saved Columns</b> to select the column profile you want to use. The columns will immediately be applied.</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Multi-Column&#160;Sort</h3>
        <p>In some cases, you may want to sort by multiple columns at once. For instance, you might want to sort first by a "Company Name"&#160;field, and then by the document's creation date. You can now do so using multi-column sort. To sort by multiple columns, click <b>Display Options</b> in the Folder Browser and select <b>Sort Columns</b>. You can then select which column you want to sort by first, which second, and so on. In the column sort bar, you can also drag and drop to reorder the columns, and determine whether to sort them in ascending or descending order. </p>

        </p>
        <h2>Automatic Server-Side OCR</h2>
        <p>In addition to generating text while scanning and when importing electronic files such as <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Word (MS)" /> documents, <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.LF Cloud" /> now generates text from images when they are imported into your repository. When an image file is imported into <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Laserfiche" />, a document will be created in the repository, and then the images will be OCRed by the <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.LF Server" /> in the background. This makes these documents full-text searchable without having to import the documents through <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Import Agent" /> or the desktop Client.</p>
        <h2>Document Preview Pane</h2>
        <p>You can now view a preview of documents with image pages directly from the Folder Browser. This allows you to quickly locate the document you're looking for without having to open each one. You can zoom in or out, and switch from preview mode to thumbnail mode (allowing you to see more pages at once). In addition, any annotations on the page will also be displayed, allowing you to view them without leaving the Folder Browser.</p>
