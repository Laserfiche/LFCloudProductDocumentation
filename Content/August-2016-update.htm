        <p>The August 2016 update of Laserfiche Cloud includes many new features, as well as updates to existing features. These include configurable toolbars, improvements to security including the ability to generate security reports, and various usability and performance enhancements. Other updates include Forms support in the Laserfiche App and expanding direct approval support in Forms. For Solution Providers, the update includes changes to the trial account creation process and time frames.</p>
        <p>You can watch an overview of the new features here:</p><iframe width="100%" height="557" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/New-Features-in-Laserfiche-Cloud-August-2016/New-Features-in-Laserfiche-Cloud-August-2016.html"></iframe>
        <h2>Toolbar Configuration</h2>
        <p>You can now configure the buttons that will appear on the toolbar when working in your repository. This allows you to remove actions that are not relevant to your work from the toolbar or add actions that you need to access frequently. You can display frequently-used actions <b>On toolbar</b> or hide infrequently-used actions <b>Under More Actions button</b>. The actions that you choose to hide will still be available as options under the <b>More Actions</b> button (<img src="Resources/Images/more-actions-button.png" />). Toolbar configuration options are available in the <b>Tools</b> section of the <b>Options</b> page. Toolbars are customized based on their location in Laserfiche, allowing you to set different buttons for the Folder Browser and Document Viewer.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Users who have been granted the <b>Manage Repository Configuration</b> privilege can also set defaults for the entire repository. These defaults will be used instead of the generic repository defaults for any user who has not customized their toolbar. Administrators can also replace user-specific toolbars with their own defaults using the <b>Lock down toolbar</b> option.</p>

        <h2>Security Enhancements</h2>
        <p>Several security enhancements have been included in Laserfiche to allow you to more easily secure your documents.</p>
        <h3>Security Reports</h3>
        <p>Users with the <b>Manage Entry Access</b> privilege can now run security reports on users and entries to quickly determine what rights have been applied. Security reports allow you to generate printable HTML&#160;lists and tables, text files, or Microsoft Excel spreadsheets that contain information about your security configuration, for troubleshooting or compliance purposes.</p>
        <p>There are two types of security reports:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Entry Effective Rights Reports</b> allow you to view the effective rights on the specified entry. You can generate a report for all users, or only for specific users and groups, and you can specify which rights to include in the report. </li>
            <li><b>User Effective Rights Reports</b> allow you to view the effective rights for a specified user or group on selected entries. If you select a folder, the report will include all child entries. You can specify which rights to include in the report.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Improved Security Configuration</h3>
        <p>To simplify security configuration, the <b>Access Rights</b> dialog box now groups similar rights, allowing you to quickly grant access to users. (You can still expand the groupings to fine-tune your security.) This allows you to streamline security while still ensuring that documents are only available for viewing or modification for specific users or groups.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Usability Enhancements</h2>
        <p>In addition to various performance enhancements, the August 2016 release includes a number of usability and user experience improvements.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Streaming for Attachment Annotations:</b>&#160;Audio and video attachment annotations can now be streamed in the browser, just as audio and video electronic documents can be streamed.</li>
            <li><b>Refresh Button:</b> A refresh button allows users to refresh the folder browser without refreshing the entire window.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Laserfiche Cloud Forms Support in the Laserfiche App </h2>
        <p>The Laserfiche App has been expanded to include Laserfiche Forms. You can now fill out and submit Forms directly from the App. Additionally, all your form tasks and history are available from the app’s main menu.</p>
        <h2>Direct Approval Email Support in Forms</h2>
        <p>You can now directly approve Forms tasks from your email inbox.  Reply to the task notification email and the task will be automatically approved, rejected, or submitted.</p>
        <h2>Trial Account Updates</h2>
        <p>The August update streamlines the trial account period. Trial Accounts stay active for 45 days starting from the date of creation. Solution Providers have the option of extending the trial period by 30 days for a total of 75 active days.</p>
        <p>Authorized Laserfiche staff can potentially reactivate an expired trial account that has exceeded the 75-day trial period. Solution Providers can contact their Territory Manager to start the approval process.</p>
