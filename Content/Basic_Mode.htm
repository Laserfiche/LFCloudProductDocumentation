        <h1>Scanning in Basic Mode</h1>
        <p>Basic Mode is one of two <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.LF Scanning" /> modes. It provides a fast and streamlined interface and is ideal for simple scanning tasks. </p>
        <p>Basic scanning mode offers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic image enhancements, such as page rotation, deskewing, and despeckling.</li>
            <li>Text generation using OCR&#160;(optical character recognition).</li>
            <li>An interface to fill in properties of the document before storing it.</li>
            <li>The ability to send one document at a time to your repository.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ex"><b>Tip</b>:&#160;If you need more advanced image enhancements, or want to scan multiple documents at once, you can use standard scanning mode.</p>
