        <h1>Core Security:&#160;Entry Access Rights, Feature Rights, and Privileges</h1>
        <p>Three security features must be considered for all repositories. These features form the backbone of repository security:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><a href="Access_Rights.htm">Entry Access Rights</a>, which control whether and how users work with documents, folders, and shortcuts in the repository.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="Privileges.htm#Feature">Feature Rights</a>, which control what tasks users can do across an entire repository.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><a href="Privileges.htm#Privileg">Privileges</a>, which provide access to powerful administrative features.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other security features are considered <a href="Supplemental-Security.htm">supplemental security</a>, and may or may not be necessary for any given organization.</p>
