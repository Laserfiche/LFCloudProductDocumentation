        <h1>Creating New Documents</h1>
        <p>You can create new, blank documents directly in your repository. <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Laserfiche" /> supports creating new <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Word (MS)" /> documents, <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.PowerPoint" /> presentations, or <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Excel" /> spreadsheets, as well as new documents with no contents. For example, you might choose to create a blank <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Word (MS)" /> document and then open it to fill it with your content. You could also create blank documents as placeholders, for instance, to represent physical objects in a records management scenario.</p>
        <p>To create a new document, open the folder in which you want to create it. Right-click and point to <b>New</b>, then select <b><MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Word (MS)" /> Document</b>, <b><MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.PowerPoint" /> Presentation</b>, <b><MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Excel" /> Spreadsheet</b>, or <b>Blank Document</b>. You will be prompted to provide information about the document, including name, template and fields, tags, and locations, as you would for an imported document; see <a href="Importing_Files.htm">Importing Files</a> for details. You can then open and modify the document as you would any other document of that type.</p>
