            <MadCap:concept term="Forms" />Team Filters</h1>
        <p>You can automatically assign tasks to subsets of <a href="../../../../Forms/Trunk/English/Laserfiche Forms Help Project/Content/Inbox-And-Teams/Teams.htm">teams</a> with a <a href="../../../../Forms/Trunk/English/Laserfiche Forms Help Project/Content/User-Tasks.htm">User Task</a>. By adding a filter to the team, you can assign the task to users who have a specific role on the team or who share some other criteria. A couple common filters are provided for you, or you can write a custom filter with <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.JavaScript" /> expressions. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To filter team members</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the <b>Assign</b> tab of the task, select the <b>Team</b> option.</li>
            <li>Chose the team you want to filter from the drop-down menu.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>Add filter</b> link.</li>
            <li>From the <b>Select filter</b> drop-down menu, select one of the following:</li>
            <ul>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include"><b>Managers Only:</b> Click this option to assign the task to all the managers on the team.  If only one user on the team is a manager, the user will be assigned the task directly and it will appear in their <b>My Tasks</b> tab. If there are multiple managers on the team, the task will appear in the <b>Available</b> tab for all managers. From there, they can assign the task to themselves to complete it. </li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include"><b>Non-Managers Only:</b>  Click this option to assign the task to everyone on the team who is not a manager. The task will appear in the <b>Available</b> tab for all non-managers. From there, a team member can assign the task to themselves to complete it or a manager can assign the task to them.   If only one user on the team is not a manager, the user will be assigned the task directly and it will appear in their <b>My Tasks</b> tab.</li>
                <li><b>Select a saved filter for the team:</b> If someone has already configured filters for this team, they will appear in a list here. Select a filter to apply it. If you want to make changes to this filter, click the <b>Edit</b> button in the top right of the filter's definition, and then follow the instructions for creating a filter below. </li>
                <li><b>Create a new filter:</b> Select this option if you want to create a custom filter with <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.JavaScript" />. </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To create a custom filter</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select <b>Create new filter</b> from the filter drop-down menu. </li>
            <li>Next to <b>Name</b>, type a descriptive name for your filter.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include">Under <b>Definition</b>, select <b><MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.JavaScript" /></b> or <b><MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.XPath" /></b>. <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.XPath" /> filters are easier to configure than <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.JavaScript" /> filters because you can configure them by selecting a series of options from drop-down menus. The <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.JavaScript" /> option allows for more customization and flexibility, but they can be harder to write, even with the pre-configured expressions provided. </li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include">If you selected <b><MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.XPath" /></b>, click in the textbox.</li>
            <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
                <li MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include">From the first drop-down menu in the dialog box that appears, chose if you want the filter to assign tasks to managers, non-managers, or users that have (or don't have)&#160;a specific role. <ul><li MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include">If you selected <b>Role</b>, choose <b>=</b> if the task should go to users with a specific role, or <b>!=</b> if the task should go to users without a specific role. In the last drop-down menu, select a role. </li></ul></li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include">Once you've configured your initial condition, click <b>Insert</b>. The condition will appear in the text box below. </li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include">Continue to add conditions as desired, using the <b>and</b>, <b>or</b>, and parentheses <b>( )</b> operators to combine conditions. </li>
                <div class="ex">
                    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include"><b>Example:</b> You could create a filter that assigns tasks to non-managers with the Quality Assurance role. </p>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include">

                    </p>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include">Or, you could create a filter that assigns tasks to managers who don't have the Executive role. </p>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include">

                    </p>
                </div>
            </ol>
            <li>Use the <b>Method</b> drop-down menu to select <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.JavaScript" /> methods that will filter the team members. <a href="../../../../Forms/Trunk/English/Laserfiche Forms Help Project/Content/Inbox-And-Teams/JavaScript-Filter-Expressions.htm">Learn more</a>. Ensure your finished script includes an expression that sets the value of the <b>$result</b> variable (which is declared before your script runs). </li>
            <li>After you define a filter, click the <b>Test</b> button to see how many users the filter will return. If the filter doesn't return any team members, edit the filter until it returns team members or <a href="../../../../Forms/Trunk/English/Laserfiche Forms Help Project/Content/Inbox-And-Teams/Teams.htm#Editing">add team members that fit your filter's criteria</a>. </li>
