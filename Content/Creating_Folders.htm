        <h1>Creating Folders</h1>
        <p>In addition to adding documents to your <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Laserfiche Repository" />, you can also create folders to organize those documents.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Creating a Folder</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the folder in which you want to create a new folder.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>New Folder</b> button (<img src="Resources/Images/fb_new_folder_button.png" />), or right-click and select <b>New Folder</b>.</li>
            <li>Type a name for your new folder and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Copying an Existing Folder Structure</h2>
        <p>In some cases, it is convenient to copy an entire folder structure, but not copy the documents within it. For instance, you might need to create the same folder structure for each client, but not use the same documents within those folders. You can do so by copying only the folders.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Navigate to the topmost folder of the folder structure that you want to copy.</li>
            <li>Select the folder and click the <b>Move or Copy</b> button, or right click and select <b>Move or Copy</b>.</li>
            <li>Select the <b>Copy folders only</b> option.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the folder where you want to copy the folder structure and select <b>Paste</b>.</li>
        </ol>
