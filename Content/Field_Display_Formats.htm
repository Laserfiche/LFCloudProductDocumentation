        <h1>Field Display Formats</h1>
        <p>You can customize the way that Laserfiche displays date, time and number field values.&#160;This customizing can be done on a field-by-field basis. For example, you might choose to always display one number field as a percentage (so that the value "90" will be displayed as "90%"), and a different number field as currency (so that the value "345.98" will be displayed as "$345.98").</p>
        <p>Laserfiche provides several default field displays:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Number field:</b> General, Percent, Scientific (scientific notation), and Currency (select the specific currency you want to display from the list)</li>
            <li><b>Date field:</b> Long date, Short date. </li>
            <li><b>Time field:</b> Long time, Short time.</li>
            <li><b>Date/Time field:</b> Long date/time, Short date/time. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b>&#160;Long and short date and time display will match the locale settings of your browser.</p>
        <p>You can also create a custom field display format.The syntax depends on whether you are working with a number field, or a date or time field.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Custom Number Field Display</h2>
        <p>A number pattern is a string of characters that consists of some combination of literal characters and symbols. A literal character is a character that will be displayed as you type it in the field format; a symbol will be replaced by the value or values it represents. The pattern determined by the combination of these will control how numbers are displayed in that field. In some cases, a symbol might indicate that a particular operation will be performed on the value for display purposes.</p>
        <p>The table below lists the possible elements of a number pattern and the symbol used to represent them in the pattern. Examples are provided below the table.</p>

        <h2 class="topicheading">Custom Date and Time Field Display</h2>
        <p>A date or time pattern is a string of characters that will be replaced by the actual date and time value input in a field. The pattern determines what date or time information will be displayed, and how it will be displayed. Since the default date and time display options use the client computer settings, you can use a custom date, time or date/time field if you want to display dates and times consistently between client computers. You can also use them to display information not contained within the default date and time fields, such as the quarter or era.</p>
        <p>The table below lists all of the possible elements of a date or time pattern, the symbol used to represent them, and an example of how the final value would be displayed. In some cases, the same element may have several different display options. &#160;For example, the symbol y is used for the year, but you can control whether to display all four digits, such as "1999"&#160;(in which case you would use the pattern "y"&#160;or "yyyy"), or to display just the last two digits, such as "99"&#160;(in which case you would use the pattern "yy"). </p>
        <p>"Stand Alone" values refer to those designed to stand on their own, as opposed to being with other formatted values. if you want to store the current quarter alone, as “2nd quarter”, you would use the stand alone format (QQQQ), whereas “2nd quarter 2007” would use the regular format (qqqq yyyy). In some locales the “Stand Alone” outputs might differ from those of their regular symbol counterparts.    </p>

        <p>Letters may be included in the pattern, but they must be enclosed in single quotes. For example, the pattern "qqqq 'of' yyyy"&#160;would be returned as "2nd Quarter of 2009". Other characters besides single quotes and letters may be included as-is, without needing to be enclosed. For example, the pattern "hh:mm:ss" would return "09:15:45".</p>
