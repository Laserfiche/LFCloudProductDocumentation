        <h1>Field and Template Access Rights</h1>
        <p>Field and template rights allow you to control how fields can be accessed and modified in your repository. For instance, you could secure a sensitive field, such as a social security number, so that only users who should be able to see that sensitive information can access it. You can also secure fields to prevent people from modifying them, secure templates to hide the entire template from certain users, and use security to determine what users or groups should be able to modify a field or template's definition in Repository Administration.</p>
