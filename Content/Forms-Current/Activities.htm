        <h1>Activities</h1>
        <p>In a <a href="Business-Processes.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">business process</a>, activities are components that involve actions by either users or applications. There are two kinds of activities: <b>tasks</b> and <b>sub-processes</b>. Tasks are activities performed by users (<a href="User-Tasks.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">user tasks</a>) or applications (<a href="Service-Tasks.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">service tasks</a>). <a href="Building-Sub-processes.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Sub-processes</a> are processes that occur within a larger business process and contain their own activities.</p>
        <p>In a process diagram, activities are represented by gray rectangular icons. <a href="Timer-Catch-Events.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Timer catch events</a> and <a href="Signal-Throw-and-Catch-Events.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">signal catch events</a> can be attached to user tasks and sub-processes. An activity can lead to multiple <a href="Outflows.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">outflows</a>, where which outflows are taken depends on what happens in the activity.</p>
