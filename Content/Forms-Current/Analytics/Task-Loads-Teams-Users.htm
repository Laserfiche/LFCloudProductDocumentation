        <h1>Team and User Workloads</h1>
        <p>On the <b>Reports</b> page, the <b>Workload</b> section lets you view how in-progress and completed tasks are distributed over users or teams.</p>
        <h2>Workload Report Settings</h2>
        <p>In the left pane, select the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The process you want to view data for.</li>
            <li>Whether you want to see workloads for each user or for each team.</li>
            <li>Whether you to include completed tasks in the data. If you don't select <b>Completed tasks</b>, only in-progress tasks will be shown<ul><li>If you select <b>Completed tasks</b>, you can further specify the date range of completed tasks to view.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>After selecting these criteria in the <b>Settings</b> pane, click <b>Apply</b>. If the selected process has sufficient data, you will see a bar chart displaying the number of tasks that each user/team has completed or has in progress.</p>
        <h2>Workload Details for a Process</h2>
        <p>Once you've created a bar chart report, you can expand the <b>Details</b> pane on the right to view data about who has the highest workload, highest number of completed tasks, and highest number of in-progress tasks.</p>
        <h2>Workload Details by User or Team</h2>
        <p>Once you've created a bar chart report, you can view more information about the workload of each user or team by clicking on the bar that corresponds to that workload. This expands a <b>Details</b> pane on the right that contains more details about the tasks represented by the bar. The <b>Details</b> pane contains information like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The user or team's current tasks.</li>
            <li>For a team, the number of unassigned tasks.</li>
            <li>The most recently completed tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From this view of a user's or team's workload details, you can navigate to a display of workload information about the overall process by clicking <b>View process details</b> in the <b>Details</b> pane.</p>
