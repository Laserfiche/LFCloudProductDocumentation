        <h1>Viewing Process Completion Rates</h1>
        <p>On the <b>Reports</b> page, click <b>Performance</b> to view data about how quickly your process instances are being completed. The time it takes an instance to be completed is known as the <b>cycle time</b>.</p>
        <h2>Selecting a Process and Date Range</h2>
        <p>You can view completion rate statistics for individual processes over a selected date range.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the <b>Reports</b> page, click on <b>Performance</b>.</li>
            <li>In the left pane, select the process of interest under <b>Process</b>.</li>
            <li>Under <b>Date range</b>, select the date range that you want to view data for.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Apply</b> at the bottom of the pane. If your selected process has instances in that date range, you'll see a scatter plot and bar chart showing you the cycle times and number of instances over time.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Scatter Plot of Cycle Times</h2>
        <p>If you've selected a process and date range and the process has instances completed in that range, you'll see a scatter plot showing cycle times for different dates. By default, the plot displays the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each dot represents an instance that completed on the indicated date (the dot's x-axis value) with the indicated cycle time (the dot's y-axis value).</li>
            <li>The median cycle time is represented with a green dot.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can reveal further details in the scatter plot by interacting with it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on the dot representing an instance to view the instance's details.<ul><li>In the <b>Instance Details</b> pane, select the instance name to <a href="../Monitoring-Process-Instances-and-Tasks.htm#Viewing2" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">view the instance's action history and variable values</a>.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Hover over an instance's dot to see its date of completion and cycle time.</li>
            <li>To zoom in on a specific part of the scatter plot, click the <b>Zoom mode</b> icon, then drag your cursor to delineate a rectangular region on the plot to zoom in to.<ul><li>To reset to a full view of the scatter plot, click the <b>Reset</b> icon.</li></ul></li>
            <li>A&#160;percentile line indicates that the instances below that line make up a certain percentage of that process' instances. Use the <b>Percentile</b> icon to add and remove percentile lines to your scatter plot.<ul><li>&#160;View percentile lines by clicking the <b>Percentile</b> icon and selecting a percentile value.</li><li>To remove an existing percentile line, click the <b>Percentile</b> icon again and select the percentile whose line you want to remove.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Distribution of Instances over Time</h2>
        <p>If you've selected a process and date range and the process has instances completed in that range, you'll see a bar chart displaying the distribution of instance completion dates.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select a section of the bar chart to bring up a <b>Selection Details</b> pane containing statistics for the selected section.</li>
            <li>Click <b>View process details</b> to see data about all instances.</li>
        </ul>
