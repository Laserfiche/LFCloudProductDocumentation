        <h1>Viewing Process Irregularities</h1>
        <p>On the Reports page, the Irregularity report shows you which tasks from a process have been suspended or terminated, and the number of times this occurred. This report displays statistics for both user tasks and service tasks.</p>
        <h2>Selecting a Process and Date Range</h2>
        <p>You can view suspended tasks, terminated tasks, or both for individual processes over a selected date range.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the Reports page, click on Irregularities.</li>
            <li>In the left pane, select the process of interest under <b>Process</b>.</li>
            <li>Under <b>Version</b>, select the desired version to review. The latest published version is selected by default.</li>
            <li>Under <b>Date range</b>, select the date range that you want to view data for.</li>
            <li>Under <b>Task status</b>, check which types of irregularities you wish to see. Both suspended and terminated are selected by default.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Apply</b> at the bottom of the pane. If your selected process has instances with irregularities in that date range, you'll see a bar chart showing you the tasks and number of irregularities for each task that occurred.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Chart of Irregularity Data</h2>
        <p>If you've selected a process and date range and the process has instances with irregularities in that range, you'll see a bar chart showing tasks with counts of irregularities. By default, the chart displays the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each bar represents a task in the process, and the number of times it has been suspended or terminated.</li>
            <li>By default, the chart is in stacked view, combining suspended and terminated instances in a single bar separated by color. Click the Grouped chart icon (<img src="../Resources/Images/GroupedIcon.png" style="vertical-align: top;" />) to view each type as a separate bar.</li>
            <li>To view additional information about the tasks, click the bar area for that task. In the right pane, it will indicate the type of irregularity, with a link to <b>View Tasks</b>.</li>
            <li>Click <b>View Tasks</b> to see and/or download a list of the instance details for each instance in which the irregularity occured.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This information can be useful for troubleshooting where in a process an issue may be occurring.</p>
