        <p> Sub-processes are parts of a larger <a href="Business-Processes.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">process</a> that contain their own start and end events. Sub-processes are helpful for organizing complex processes into manageable sections.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>:&#160; Sub-processes cannot contain a message start event or timer start event. </p>
        <p><b>To build a sub-process</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the <b>Sub-process</b> object to the canvas. </li>
            <li>Connect the sub-process to other objects in your process with sequence flows.</li>
            <li>Click the tab labeled with your sub-process's name at the bottom of the canvas or in the left pane to open the process diagram for the sub-process. When you have many sub-processes, use the arrows to in the bottom right corner to scroll to a sub-process.</li>
            <p>

            <li><a href="Building-a-Process.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Build</a> your sub-process as you would any other process: Drag objects onto the canvas and then connect and configure them. Like main processes, sub-processes must also being with a <a href="Start-Events.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">start event</a>, and any process flows in the sub-process must end with <a href="End-Events.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">end events</a>.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Save</b>.</li>

        <p><b>To configure a sub-process</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the process diagram for the main process, double-click the sub-process to open its properties pane.</li>
            <li>Type a name for the sub-process in <b>Name</b>.</li>
            <li>Under <b>Description</b>, describe the role of the sub-process in the main process.</li>
            <li>Configure the <a href="Outflows.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">outflow path</a> conditions after you connect the sub-process to other objects on the canvas. Like other <a href="Activities.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">activities</a>, sub-processes can have multiple outflow paths.</li>
