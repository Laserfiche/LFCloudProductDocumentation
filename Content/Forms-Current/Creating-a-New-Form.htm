        <p>In a <a href="Business-Processes.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">business process</a>, forms help to collect data from users and allow users to carry out actions (approving, denying, editing) on existing form data. New forms can be created from within the process designer or form designer.</p>
        <p>The following sections show you a few different ways to create a new form. After you've created the form, <a href="Adding-Fields-to-a-Form.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">add fields to it</a> by dragging and dropping fields from the left pane onto the form canvas.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">From the Left Navigation Bar</h2>
        <p>From the left navigation bar of the process designer, click <b>Forms, </b>then <b>Create new form</b>:</p>
