        <h1>Direct Approval</h1>
        <p>The <b>Direct Approval</b> option for a <a href="User-Tasks.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">user task</a> lets you perform actions without opening the task. Direct approval is an option you can select when you are configuring a user task. If a task has direct approval, you can complete the task through the details pane in <b>Tasks</b> on the Laserfiche home screen. Because you can perform direct approval actions on a form that has required fields, ensure that the direct approval option is <i>disabled</i> when you want a user to complete certain fields.</p>
        <h2>Using Direct Approval in the Tasks Tab</h2>
        <p>After the <b>Direct Approval</b> option is selected in a user task, the details pane in the <a href="Managing-Tasks-in-the-Inbox.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Tasks tab</a> for the user task displays action buttons based on the <a href="User-Tasks.htm#Configur" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">action buttons you configure in the task</a>. The following image shows you what it looks like when <b>Submit</b> and <b>Approve</b> are configured in the process designer. In this example, you can select one of the action buttons to take a direct action on the task.</p>
