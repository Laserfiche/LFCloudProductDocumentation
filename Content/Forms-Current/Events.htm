        <h1>Events</h1>
        <p>Events determine how <a href="Key-Concepts-in-Forms.htm#Process" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">process flows</a> start, end, and send signals to each other in the middle. In Laserfiche Process Automation, <a href="Business-Processes.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">business processes</a> can contain three types of events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Start events</b>: These start a business process and are colored green in the process diagram.</li>
            <li><b>Intermediate events</b>: These happen during a process and are colored yellow in the process diagram.</li>
            <li><b>End events</b>. These stop a process or process flow and are colored red. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every process starts with one of the types of start events, and every process flow has to end with one of the types of end events.</p>
        <p><b>Catch events</b> can control when certain paths in the process are taken in reaction to specific events. Based on how or when the event is completed, the catch event can start another process flow.</p>
