        <h1>Collections</h1>
        <p>Collections are a structural element you can use to group fields together so they can be repeated as a set. To use a collection, drag it onto the canvas and then drag fields into the collection.</p>
        <div class="ex">
            <p><b>Example:</b> You want to gather the name, age, and gender of each of the form submitter's children. By placing these fields into a collection, the person filling out the form can click an "Add" button to input the name, age, and gender of more than one child.</p>

                    <li>Under <b>Field label</b>, enter the name that will appear above the collection on the form.

                    <li>
                        <MadCap:concept term="Forms" />Under <b>Variable</b>, specify a name for the field <a href="../Variables.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">variable</a> associated with this field. If you do not specify a variable name, Laserfiche will automatically assign the field one based on its label.<br /><p class="ex"><b>Tip:</b> If you added this collection as a variable from another form, and then edited the original collection by adding more fields, you can add those extra fields to this collection by clicking <b>Add a field from variable</b>. </p></li>
                    <li>Under <b>Text above field</b> and <b>Text below field</b>, you can enter any additional text that should appear with the field. Click the <b>Insert Variables</b> button to include a variable with this text.</li>
                    <li>Under <b>Collection options</b> for Classic mode or the <b>Advanced</b> tab for Modern mode, you can choose if a collection will have a fixed number of sets or if users can add sets.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Range of sets:</b> Select this option to allow the collection to have a range of sets. This option is helpful in the following situations</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>&#160;If you want the collection to have a set minimum number of sets and then allow users add up to a maximum number of sets. </li>
                            <li>If the collection is being populated with data from a data source or a variable, then you might not know the exact number of sets being populated, so setting a range allows for some flexibility. In this situation, the minimum number of sets specified will always be displayed, even if you don't have enough values from the data source or variable to fill them (blank sets will be added until the minimum is reached). Users can always manually add sets up to the maximum number specified. If the number of sets returned by the data source or variable is the maximum number of sets or higher, the number of sets will be capped at the maximum, and users won't be able to add sets. </li>
                            <p class="ex"><b>Tip:</b> Leave the maximum value blank to return all sets from the data source or variable, or to let users add an unlimited number of sets. </p>
                        </ul>
                        <li><b>Fixed number of sets:</b> Select this option to specify the number of sets in the collection. If the collection is being populated from a data source or variable, the results will be capped at this number of sets. If fewer than this number of sets are returned from a data source or variable, the remaining sets will be left blank. Users cannot add sets with this option. </li>
                        <li><b>Append sets to the sets populated by a data source or variable:</b> Select this option if you want to return all sets from a data source or variable and then  append sets to the bottom of that list. In the <b>Min</b> text box, specify the number of sets that will be automatically added to whatever sets are returned by the data source or variable. In the <b>Max</b> text box, specify the total number of sets that can be added to the sets returned by the data source or variable. Users will be able to add up to this number of sets by clicking the link for adding sets. Set both these numbers to zero if you only want to display  all the lookup or variable results and not let users add to the collection. </li>

                <p class="note"><b>Note</b>:The <a href="../Service-Tasks.htm#Save" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Save to Repository service task</a> supports process variables that can retrieve values from a specific row in a table or a set in a collection that can be used in a document name or template field. For example, suppose you design a table with a <a href="Single-Line.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Single Line</a> field and a <a href="File-Upload.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">File Upload</a> field. If the table has 2 rows of values, setting the file upload document name in the Save to Repository service task to <span style="font-family: 'Courier New';">{/dataset/Table_variable_name/Single_Line_variable_name[Row()]}</span> will cause the first file to use the first row's value and the second file to use the second row's value.</p>
