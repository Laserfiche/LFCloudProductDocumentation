            <MadCap:concept term="Forms" />Sections</h1>
        <p>Sections are visually distinct, collapsible segments of a form. Each field placed under a section is part of that section.</p>
        <p>Sections can be read-only. For example, if you want a form to be read only but you still need users to sign it, put all the fields, except the <a href="Signatures.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Signature field</a>, in a section and set it to read-only.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Settings</h2>
        <p><b>To edit a section</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the section on the canvas and click <b>Edit</b>.</li>
            <li>Under <b>Field label</b>, enter the name that will appear above the section on the form.  Click the <b>Insert Variables</b> button to include a variable with this label.<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: The header for a section in a form is an <b>h2</b> header, not an <b>h1</b> header. Only the header of the form can be an <b>h1</b> header.</p></li>
            <li>Under <b>Section label options</b>, choose among the following options:<ul><li><b>Hide the section label, border, and the text below the label:</b> This option hides these elements of the section on the form. This option is useful if you want to make a section of your form read-only (see Step 5)&#160;and do not want the visual clutter of section headings. </li><li><b>Allow users to collapse and expand this section:</b> If you choose to show the section label, you can select to allow users to collapse or expand the section. Selecting this option will display an expand/collapse button next to the section label. If you select this option, you can choose the default state (expanded or collapsed) of the section from the drop-down menu that appears.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Under <b>Text below field</b>, you can enter any additional text that should appear with the section. Click the <b>Insert Variables</b> button to include a variable with this text.</li>
            <li>Under <b>Section options</b>, select <b>Read-only</b> to make the fields between this section and the next section (or the end of the form) read-only. Users cannot edit read-only fields. </li>
            <li>To configure advanced options, click the <b>Advanced</b> tab.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Under <b>CSS&#160;class</b>, specify a CSS&#160;class to assign to this section.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>When you are finished editing the settings, click <b>Done</b>. Your changes will be saved automatically.</li>
