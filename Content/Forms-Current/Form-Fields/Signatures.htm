        <h1>Signature Fields</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Forms" />Signature fields are specialized fields that allow users to sign a form with a stylus, finger, or by entering their name. If desired, you can configure signatures on the form to be unmodifiable after the form is submitted.</p>

                    <li>Select the field on the canvas, and the options will appear in the right pane.</li>
                    <li>Under <b>Field label</b>, enter the field label that will appear next to the field on the form. </li>
                    <li>
                        <MadCap:concept term="Forms" />Under <b>Variable</b>, specify a name for the field <a href="../Variables.htm">variable</a> associated with this field. If you do not specify a variable name, Forms will automatically assign the field one based on its label.</li>
                    <li>Under <b>Text above field</b> and <b>Text below field</b>, you can enter any additional text that should appear with the field. Click the <b>Insert variable</b> button to include a variable with this text.</li>
                    <li>Under <b>Display options,</b>  select <b>Required</b> if users must fill in this field before submitting the form. Select <b>Read-only</b> if users should not be allowed to modify this field. </li>
                    <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> If a required field is hidden with a <a href="../Creating-Rules-to-Show-or-Hide-Fields.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">field rule</a>, it is no longer required. A required field is only required when it appears on the form. </p>
                    <p class="ex"><b>Tip:</b> If a specific signature field is used on multiple forms (e.g. you used the field's variable to add it to multiple forms), the signature value will not be carried over to the other forms  unless it's made to be display-only. For example, suppose Sally has a form that needs to be signed by an employee and then routed to a manager for review. On the form that the employee signs, the signature field is not display-only, allowing the employee to sign the form. On the form the manager reviews, Sally makes the signature field display-only so the manager will see the employee's signature instead of a Sign button.</p>
                    <li>Under <b>Signature Size</b>, specify the signature field width if needed to fit within your form design.</li>
                    <li>Under <b>Button label</b>, edit the text of the button displayed.</li>
                    <li>Under <b>Sign Options</b> select <b>Use the default signature for the current user (if applicable)</b>to allow registered users to re-use an existing signature if available.</li>
                    <li>Under <b>Signature Input Method</b> select which format(s) of signature may be used. <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Requiring a drawn signature may introduce limitations for accessibility by requiring the use of a mouse or touch screen.</p></li>
