        <h1>Signature Fields</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Forms" />Signature fields are specialized fields that allow users to sign a form with a stylus, finger, or by entering their name. If desired, you can configure signatures on form to be unmodifiable after the form is submitted.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Field Settings</h2>
        <p><b>To edit a signature field</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the field on the canvas and click <b>Edit</b>.</li>
            <li>Type the field label under <b>Field label</b>.</li>
            <li>Type a name for the field <a href="../Variables.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">variable</a> for this field under <b>Variables</b>. If you do not specify a name, one will be assigned based on the field label.</li>
            <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> When monitoring processes, if you want to see information about who signed a field and when, refer to the step information or collect this information in other fields on the form. Signature variables are not available in <a href="../Using-Conditional-Expressions.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">conditional expressions</a>.</p>
            <li>Specify additional details about the field under <b>Field options</b>:<ul><li><b>Required</b>: Users must fill in this field before submitting the form. If a required field is hidden with a <a href="../Creating-Rules-to-Show-or-Hide-Fields.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">field rule</a>, it is no longer required.</li><li><b>Display-only</b>: Users cannot modify this field after the form is submitted.</li></ul></li>
            <p class="ex"><b>Tip:</b> If a specific signature field is used on multiple forms (e.g. you used the field's variable to add it to multiple forms), the signature value will not be carried over to the other forms  unless it's made to be display-only. For example, suppose Sally has a form that needs to be signed by an employee and then routed to a manager for review. On the form that the employee signs, the signature field is not display-only, allowing the employee to sign the form. On the form the manager reviews, Sally <a href="#Displayi" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">makes the signature field display-only</a> so the manager will see the employee's signature instead of a Sign button.</p>
            <li><b>Optional</b>:&#160;Type additional text around the field under <b>Text above field</b> and <b>Text below field</b>. Click the <b>Insert variables</b> button to insert a variable into the text.</li>
            <li><b>Optional</b>: Specify the signature field width if needed to fit within your form design.</li>
            <li><b>Optional</b>: Select whether users will be allowed to use a saved default signature or be prompted to sign the form.<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> When signing a form, users will always have to option to use the signature as a default for future forms.</p></li>
            <li>To configure advanced options, click the <b>Advanced</b> tab.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Under <b>Tooltip</b>, specify the help text that will appear when users hover over the field. Click the <b>Insert variables</b> button to insert a variable into the text.</li>
                <li>Under <b>CSS&#160;class</b>, specify a CSS&#160;class to assign to this field. </li>
            </ul>
            <li>When you are finished editing the field settings, click <b>Done</b>. Your changes will be saved automatically.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Displayi"></a>Displaying Previous Signature Values</h2>
        <p>When a form moves from one task in a process to another, the signature value from the first form cannot appear as an editable value in the second form. This prevents others from modifying someone's signature in later form. However, you can add the signature value to a second task as a read-only value as follows.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Add and configure a signature field in the first form.</li>
            <li>Create a second form placed later in the process, and add a signature field to the second form using the first form's variable.</li>
            <li>Set the second signature field to read-only. If you do not set the field to read-only, you cannot present the original value.</li>
        </ol>
