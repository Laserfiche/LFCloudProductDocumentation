        <h1>Key Concepts in Business Processes</h1>
        <p>This page describes key concepts that are used in Laserfiche Process Automation's business processes.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Events</h2>
        <p><a href="Events.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Events</a> are parts of a process that are not <a href="Activities.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">activities</a>, <a href="Gateways.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">gateways</a>, or <a href="Building-Sub-processes.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">sub-processes</a>. They determine how process flows start, end, and send signals to each other in the middle. There are events that start a process, events that send or receive signals, events that end processes or process flows, and events that lead to other actions if certain errors are thrown. In a process diagram, events are represented by circles. All processes must start and end with events.</p>
        <h2>Field Rules</h2>
        <p>You may want your form to responsively show or hide certain fields based on how a user has filled in other fields on the form. <a href="Creating-Rules-to-Show-or-Hide-Fields.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Field rules</a> allow you to do this. They can be configured in the form designer.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Form"></a>Form Designer</h2>
        <p>The form designer is the section of the business processes website where you build a form. There are two versions of the form designer, <b>Form Designer </b>and<b> Classic Form Designer</b>. <b>Form  Designer</b> provides a WYSIWYG drag-and-drop layout page and displays items like Rules and other settings in the right panel. <b>Classic Form Designer</b> provides a drag-and-drop Layout page (where fields are added and edited), a Field Rules page, a Lookup Rules page, an Error Messages page, a Themes page, and a CSS&#160;and JavaScript page accessible via tabs. When you are building or editing a process, you can access the form designer by clicking the Forms icon in the left menu bar and either selecting from the available forms or the Create New Form link. </p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Lookup Rules</h2>
        <p>Lookup rules are rules you can define when creating a form, that allow you to automatically fill fields in a form or populate form options based on data from <a href="../Resources/Rules/Rules.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">rules</a>. They allow you to use data sources in your organization to populate forms with information.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Objects"></a>Objects</h2>
        <p>In the context of building a process, objects refer to elements that you add to a process. Objects can be <a href="Events.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">events</a>, <a href="Activities.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">activities</a>, or <a href="Gateways.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">gateways</a>. Business process objects follow the <a href="http://www.bpmn.org/" target="_blank">Business&#160;Process Model and Notation</a> (BPMN) notation and language.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Outflow</h2>
        <p>An <a href="Outflows.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">outflow</a> describes what will happen after a task, sub-process, or gateway. Outflows are key for gateways, as they specify which route a process takes when a certain condition or combination of conditions is met.</p>
        <p>The two styles of Forms Designers side by side.<br /><img src="Resources/Images/formDesignerCompare.PNG" style="border-style: solid;border-width: 1px;width: 100%;" alt="Comparison of Classic and Modern layout of the form designer" title="Use the form designer to create and edit forms" /></p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Process</h2>
        <p>A <a href="Business-Processes.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">business process</a> is a series of tasks that works towards a business goal.  Forms are often part of a business process, as they let users transmit information to the process. You can <a href="Building-a-Process.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">design</a> whole processes that determine how a form is processed after being submitted.</p>
        <p>Within a given process, there may be multiple <a href="#Process" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">process flows</a>, which represent multiple paths that can be taken by an instance of a business process.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Process2"></a>Process Designer</h2>
        <p>The process designer is the page where you can edit a process diagram. It contains a canvas where you can add, modify, or delete elements of a process.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Process Diagram</h2>
        <p>The process diagram is the part of the process designer that graphically represents a process.&#160;It shows you the component activities, events, and sub-processes, and how they are related by sequence flows. On a process diagram, your process might be divided into different stages to offer a more organized view.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Process3"></a>Process Instances</h2>
        <p>A process has a structure that the process creator defines in the process designer. Once a process has been built, you can run multiple instances of it. For example, multiple users may submit the starting form of a process. By doing so, they start multiple instances of the process.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Process"></a>Process Flow</h2>
        <p>A process flow is one possible path that can be taken in a process, as represented by following a sequence of arrows from left to right in the process diagram. Processes can contain multiple process flows, as paths can split depending on the results of tasks and events.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Repository Profile</h2>
        <p>A repository profile specifies the repository information required for a <a href="Service-Tasks.htm#Save" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Save to Repository task</a> to work.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Sequence"></a>Sequence Flow</h2>
        <p>A sequence flow is an arrow that connects one <a href="#Objects" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">object</a> in a process with the next object. Consecutive objects in a process are connected by a sequence flow. Connect two objects in a canvas by dragging the sequence flow from one object to another. In the following screenshot, there is a sequence flow going from the start event to the user task, then from the user task to the end event.</p>

Forms will warn you if there are unconnected objects on your process diagram." />
        </p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Service Tasks</h2>
        <p><a href="Service-Tasks.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Service tasks</a> are tasks that are to be completed by a non-human entity—a service or application. They are contrasted with <a href="User-Tasks.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">user tasks</a>, which require human input.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Teams</h2>
        <p>In Laserfiche Process Automation, <a href="Getting-Started-with-Team-Management.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">teams</a> are a way to organize tasks that should be assigned within a group of people. A team is composed of users who can have various security roles (team administrator, team manager, or just a team member) and other roles defined by the person creating the team. When you build a process you can arrange for user tasks to be assignable only to members of a certain team<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.For Next Version">, or to certain subsets of a team as determined by a <a href="JavaScript-Filter.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">JavaScript filter</a></MadCap:conditionalText>. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.For Next Version">Team roles can be used as a basis for assigning tasks.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">User Tasks</h2>
        <p><a href="User-Tasks.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">User tasks</a> are tasks that require human input to be completed. They include actions like filling an empty form, approving a form submission, or revising a previously submitted form. They are contrasted with <a href="Service-Tasks.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">service tasks</a>, which are tasks that are completed by a service or application.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Webhook Service Tasks</h2>
        <p>Webhook service tasks are tasks that send process information using a HTTP&#160;post request to a web service.</p>
