        <h1>Managing Processes</h1>
        <p>The <b>Manage</b> page lets you view all processes and carry out actions on them. The available actions depend on your <a href="../Resources/Managing-Account-Administration.htm#Process" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">security role</a> for the process.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="List"></a>List of Processes</h2>
        <p>The list of processes shows, for each process, the process name, the version number of the process, when it was last modified, and whether the process is enabled or disabled (under <b>Status</b>). Click on a column name to sort processes by their values in that column, or search for processes using the search bar at the top of the page.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p><b>Note</b>: The <b>Status</b> column does not show whether a process is published or unpublished, but whether it is enabled or disabled. You can tell whether a process is published or unpublished by whether it has a version number. Processes without version numbers are unpublished. Any process that has a version number is published.</p>
        </div>
        <p>For each process, you can use the following buttons  in the top right corner when the process is selected. </p>
        <ul>
