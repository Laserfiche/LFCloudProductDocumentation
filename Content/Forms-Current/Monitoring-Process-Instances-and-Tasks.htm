        </ol>
        <p class="note">Note: Before skipping a converging gateway, skip or interrupt each active branch to achieve the desired outflow.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Interrupt</p>

            <li>Select the instances you want to interrupt. All in progress and suspended processes can be interrupted.</li>
            <li>Click the interrupt button <img src="Resources/Images/interrupt_step.png" />in the top right of the page.</li>
            <li>In the Interrupt steps window, select the step(s) or action(s) you want to interrupt.</li>

        </ol>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> If the last active step in a process instance is interrupted, the instance will be listed as Completed in the status report.</p>
        <h3>Using Skip and Interrupt Effectively</h3>
        <p>Skip and Interrupt allow a Process Administrator or Business Manager to handle cases when a step will not be completed in a timely manner, as when an user task is assigned to someone who is not available and the task can not be reassigned. If there are multiple paths through the process via <a href="Gateways.htm">gateways</a>, then there is the possibility that the incomplete task may be skipped or interrupted to allow completion of the rest of the process. However, under certain conditions, this could result in later steps to be triggered multiple times.</p>
        <p class="ex">To avoid this, ensure all tasks that precede a converging gateway have been completed, skipped, or interrupted prior to skipping the gateway. If the gateway is skipped, and a step is later completed or skipped, then the gateway will trigger following steps again.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The major difference between skip and interrupt is that skip proceeds onto the next step in the process instance. Interrupt stops processing of the branch at that point, as if the step was a End step. If the interrupted step is at the end of the process or there are no other paths to follow, the process instance will be completed.</p>
