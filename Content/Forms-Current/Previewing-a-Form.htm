        <h1>Previewing a Form</h1>
        <p>During the process of creating a form, you will want to see how the form will appear to users. To do so, click the Preview button next to the Save button in either the Form Designer or Classic Form Designer. If there are unsaved changes, a prompt will ask to save or cancel. This will open a new browser tab/window that will display the form as it would appear prior to any rules being applied that might show or hide specific fields. On submitting the form, any data entered will be ignored, but post-submission actions like the thank you page will be displayed.</p>
        <h3>Form Designer Only:</h3>
        <p>If you would like to see how the form would appear to users at a specific stage within the process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the drop-down menu to the right of <b>Preview Configuration</b>. A list of all tasks and activities that use the form will be displayed, sorted by the stage that contains them. If the form is selected for a specific task or activity, a green dot will be displayed next to it's name in the list. Type a few letters of the name of a task or activity to filter the list.</li>
            <li>Select the task or activity to see how the form will look at that step in the process.</li>
            <li>To return to the default view showing all fields, click the "<b>X</b>" in the search field at the top of the drop-down.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b>&#160;Service tasks that save a PDF or image of the form data may not appear in preview mode exactly as the saved form in PDF&#160;or image format.</p>
