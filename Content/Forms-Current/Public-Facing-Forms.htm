        <h1>Allowing Access to a Process</h1>
        <p>Use the <b>Process Details</b> window in the Process Designer to configure whether a process requires the form submitter to be signed in. </p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Creating a Public Form</h2>
        <p>With a public form, organizations can collect information from any user, then route that submission through a business process. The starting form can be accessed without signing in.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> In order to create a public form, your account must have an active public portal.</p>
        <p>When a process begins with a <a href="Start-Events.htm#Message" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">message start event</a>, and the event has a starting form, you can use a link to send users to the starting form for the selected process. To create a public form, open the <b>Process Details</b> window in the Process Designer, ensure the form is enabled under Process status, and select the <b>Public</b> option under Starting Form Privacy. </p>
        <p> Use the text box at the end of the URL to make the last part of the link more descriptive. Click <b>Share</b> to copy the link.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When routing the form submission through the business process, note the following items:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>For anonymous users, the "current user" and "username" tokens will be set to "Portal"</li>
            <li>For anonymous users, the email token will be blank</li>
            <li>Submissions will appear in Monitor as Started by "Anonymous User"</li>
            <li>reCAPTCHAs will be required for all public submissions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Creating a Private Form</h2>
        <p>With a private form, the process must be started by users who sign in to start the process.</p>
        <p>To create a private form, open the <b>Process Details</b> window in the Process Designer, ensure the form is enabled under Process status, and select the <b>Private</b> option under Starting Form Privacy. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/bp-private-form.png" alt="private starting form" title="private starting form" style="border-style: solid;border-width: 1px;width: 607px;height: 345px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Choose between allowing all authenticated users to be able to start the process or granting specific users, teams, or groups access to the process.</p>
