        <h1>User Tasks</h1>
        <p>In a <a href="Business-Processes.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">business process</a>, a user task represents an action like a manager approving a form submission or a user revising a previously submitted form. In contrast, <a href="Service-Tasks.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">service tasks</a> are carried out by machines, not people.</p>
        <p>Use a user task if someone needs to take action in the business process. If a user should be notified  but will not take action, use an <a href="Service-Tasks.htm#Email" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">email service task</a>. Public users cannot participate in user tasks.</p>
        <p>The following options can be configured in a user task:</p>
        <ul>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Default.For Next Version">Any <a href="User-Task-Variables.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">user task variables</a> associated with it</li>
            <li>Who will be assigned the user task (you can assign by <a href="Getting-Started-with-Team-Management.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">team</a>, <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.For Next Version">team role, </MadCap:conditionalText>to specific individuals, or by a round-robin task distribution)</li>
            <li>Task reassignment options</li>
            <li>Email notifications to those assigned the task</li>
            <li>Task priority</li>
            <li>The form associated with the task</li>
            <li>Whether users are allowed to save the form as a draft</li>
            <li>What kinds of actions users can perform on the form (approve, reject, submit, or a custom action)</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Default.For Next Version">Whether users can perform the above actions through email</li>
            <li>The <a href="Key-Concepts-in-Forms.htm#Sequence" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">sequence flows</a> that can be taken after the task. Which flow is taken can be configured to depend on task variables.</li>

        <h3 class="topicheading">The Form tab</h3>

				<ul><li><b>Select a form</b>:&#160;Use the drop-down to choose the specific form you want users to fill out. </li><li><b>Form based on variable</b>: Use the text box and variable picker to specify the name of the form you want the user to fill out. For example, you can create a form for students to complete. If the student indicates that the student is a mathematics major, the student will be prompted with one form after submission, that differs from the form that a chemistry major gets after submission. The value of the variable helps to identify whether to use the mathematics form or the chemistry form.
						<ul><li><b>If there are no matching forms</b>:&#160;A form with the variable name may not exist. In this situation, you must indicate how you want the instance to resolve the conflict. You can specify a default form, or you can terminate the instance. </li></ul></li><li>You can also select from the following options:
						<ul><li><b>Make form read-only for users the task is assigned to</b>: Allow the users to read the document but not to edit it. Note that when you select this option, the form does not display default values, formula values, or lookup rule values; it only shows carried over values. When a field does not contain carried over values, it appears blank to read-only users.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
            <li><b>Optional</b>: Select <b>Make read-only for users this task is assigned to</b> to prevent data on the form from being altered. For instance if the task is for approving or otherwise view only of the data submitted in a previous step.</li>
            <li><b>Optional</b>: Select <b>Enable Compatibility Mode</b> if support for screen readers may be needed.<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Enabling compatibility mode alters the default focus of the page.

            <li>Under <b>Action Buttons</b>, select the types of action you want the user to be able to perform and the labels for the actions.

If the user responds with the wrong action name, he or she will receive an email notifying them action does not exist. Direct approval also allows </MadCap:conditionalText>the user to perform the task with one click from the <b><a href="Managing-Tasks-in-the-Inbox.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more."><b>Tasks</b> tab</a></b>.<p class="note" MadCap:conditions="Default.For Next Version"><b>Note</b>:&#160;In Process Automation, direct approval works only when the email reply contains the original email in the reply email.</p></li>
