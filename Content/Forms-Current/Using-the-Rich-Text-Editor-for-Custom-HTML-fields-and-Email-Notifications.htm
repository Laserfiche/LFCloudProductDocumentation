        <h1>Using the Rich-Text Editor for Custom HTML Fields and Email Notifications</h1>
        <p>When you create a <a href="Form-Fields/Custom-HTML.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Custom HTML</a> block or an <a href="User-Tasks.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">email notification</a> for a task, you can use the rich-text editor to create richly styled text without knowing any HTML.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Forms Images/richtexteditor_new.png" alt="Rich-text editor" title="The &quot;Visual&quot; mode allows you to style text as you would in other rich-text editors. The &quot;HTML&quot; mode allows you to insert raw HTML code." />
        </p>
        <p>In addition to the familiar text formatting options, the rich-text editor has several other useful features.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Insertin"></a>Inserting variables</h2>
        <p>Click the <b>Insert Variables</b> button to insert a process or field <a href="Variables.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">variable</a>. Using process and field variables in your Custom HTML blocks and email notifications is an excellent way to provide relevant information to people involved in the process.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Forms Images/insertingvariables.png" title="You can use this feature to display information on a form that differs based on other information in the process." alt="Inserting variables in the rich-text editor." style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px" />
        </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: Variables are available in <a href="Form-Fields/Custom-HTML.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Custom HTML</a> fields and <a href="User-Tasks.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">user task email notifications</a>, but not in <a href="../Forms-On-Premises/Configuring-Email-Templates.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">email templates</a>. Variables are process specific, and email templates apply to all processes.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Adding"></a>Adding pictures</h2>
        <p>Click <b>Insert picture</b> to add an image to the email notification or Custom HTML block. This is the easiest way to add an image to a form or email notification.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Forms Images/addingpictures.png" alt="Adding pictures in the rich-text editor." title="You can also use this to add pictures to a form." />
        </p>
        <p class="nestedw"><b>Important</b>: Images added this way may not be viewable from some older browsers. Supported web browsers include Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer 8 or higher (In Internet Explorer 8, the image must be smaller than 32KB), and Safari. Supported email clients include: Windows Phone 7, iOS, Android, Microsoft Outlook 2003 and higher, Yahoo! Mail, Apple Mail 4 and higher.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Inserting custom HTML</h2>
        <p>The rich-text editor allows you to insert your own custom HTML code. This is a great way to add buttons and other elements to a form. Click on the <b>Html</b> tab in the editor to insert your custom HTML code. Use <a href="Form-Fields/Custom-HTML.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Custom HTML blocks in forms</a> to display static elements like embedded documents or scrolling text boxes.</p>
        <p>
