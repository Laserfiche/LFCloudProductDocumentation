        <h1>Granting Temporary Access For Technical Support Engineers</h1>
        <p>During certain troubleshooting scenarios, it may become necessary to grant a support engineer access to your Laserfiche Cloud resources.</p>
        <p>Laserfiche Cloud customer accounts include a built-in system account named <b>SupportUser</b>. This system account is designed to allow your Solution Provider temporary access to your Laserfiche Cloud resources.</p>
        <p>The <b>SupportUser</b> account differs from standard users in that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There is a time limit associated with the account. Grant access to your Laserfiche resources only for the duration that you specify. You can remove rights from the account at any time before the time limit is up.</li>
            <li>You cannot delete the account.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Granting Access</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sign in to Laserfiche Account Administration and view the properties of the <b>SupportUser</b> user.</li>
            <li>Select the <b>Grant access</b> check box and specify how long the account should have access.</li>
            <li>Assign a strong password to the account. This password should follow the following strength requirements:<ul><li>Be at least 14 characters.</li><li>Be comprised of a mix of at least three of the five categories below:<ul><li>Uppercase letters (A through Z)</li><li>Lowercase letters (a through z)</li><li>Numbers (0 through 9)</li><li>Special characters (e.g., !, $, @, #, %)</li><li>Unicode characters (e.g., ¥, ©, π, ڛ )</li></ul></li><li>Cannot re-use last 7 previous passwords.</li><li>Cannot be changed more than once a day.</li><li>Not be comprised of an obvious keyboard sequence or common term (e.g., "qwerty", "1234567890", "password", "laserfiche").</li><li>Not part of a public password list or list of compromised passwords.</li><li>Not include easily guessed data such as personal information about yourself or published on social media (i.e., your spouse, pet, children, birthdays, addresses, college, favorite sports team).</li></ul></li>
            <li>Configure access rights to grant <b>SupportUser</b> access to specific portions of your Laserfiche Cloud resources.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Provide your Solution Provider's support contact with the <b>SupportUser</b> password to allow them access to your Laserfiche Cloud account.</p>
        <h2>Removing Access</h2>
        <p><b>SupportUser</b> automatically loses access when the specified time period ends.</p>
        <p><b>To manually remove access</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>You can remove access from the account immediately by clearing the <b>Grant access</b> check box.</li>
        </ol>
