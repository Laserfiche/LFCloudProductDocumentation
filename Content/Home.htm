        <h1>Performing Tasks and Viewing Processes</h1>
        <p>The initial Inbox page shows a list of your assigned Forms tasks. From this list, you can perform tasks assigned to you, view your submitted forms and the processes you've started, submit new forms, access and complete form drafts, and start business processes. If you have the appropriate permissions you can navigate from this page to your reports  and to a page where you can manage, edit, and create processes and forms.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Submit"></a>Submit a form and start a process</h2>
        <p>When you submit a form you are starting a process or completing a step in a process. </p>
        <p class="ex"><b>Example:</b> You have an upcoming business trip to Seattle, so you fill out a Travel Request form. While it might look like you're just submitting a form, that submission kicks off a process in which your manager approves the travel request, the office manager books your tickets, and accounting approves the expense. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: normal;">Additionally, Forms let you create processes that don't involve a form submission at all. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To submit a form and start a process</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <b>Start process</b> at the top of the page.</li>
            <li>In list of available processes, click the <b>Start</b> button next to the process you want to start. </li>
            <p class="ex"><b>Tip:</b> You can search for process with the search box at the top of the page. Additionally, click the star next to a process to make  it always appear at the top of this list. Click the star again to clear it. </p>
            <li>If the process starts with a form submission, the form will open in another tab for you to fill out. If the process starts without a form, a confirmation prompt will ask you if you want to continue. Processes that start on a schedule will not appear in this list. </li>
        </ol>
