        <h1>Working with the Laserfiche Integration with Microsoft Office 365</h1>
        <p>Before using the Laserfiche Integration with Microsoft Office 365 for the first time, you will need to sign in with your Microsoft Office 365 credentials the first time you attempt to edit a document. However, using the Laserfiche Cloud integration does not require any additional configuration.</p>
        <p><b>To use the Laserfiche Integration with Office 365: </b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Sign in to Laserfiche Cloud and navigate to your repository by clicking on the <b>App Picker</b> icon in the upper-right and choosing the repository you want to work in.
            </li>
            <li>Once in your repository, upload a new Word, Excel or Power point Document or select one of the existing documents in your repository. </li>
            <li>Click on the document title to open the document preview screen. </li>
            <li>Click the <b>Edit With</b> button in the top right. To keep working within Laserfiche Cloud client, choose the <b>Microsoft Word Online</b> option. This will redirect you to the Microsoft's hosted log-in page for Office 365. </li>
            <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Choosing <b>Microsoft Word</b> will prompt you to open the <b>Laserfiche Plugin Connector</b>, which will download the file locally to edit on your desktop.</p>
            <li>Complete signing in to Microsoft. After signing in, you will be redirected to Laserfiche  with the document open through Office Online and available for editing. </li>
            <li>Another user may co-author the document at the same time as you by signing in to Laserfiche Cloud and Microsoft Word Online. Both you and the other user will see the cursor location of the other user. All changes from both users will be persistently saved to document within the repository. </li>
        </ol>

        <p style="font-weight: normal;">There are file size constraints when viewing or editing documents with the Laserfiche Integration with Office 365. This is due to the file size limits from Microsoft Office Online. </p>

        <h2>Working with Legacy File Formats</h2>
        <p>Microsoft Office Online does not support editing files in binary formats such as doc, ppt, and xls, directly. You can choose to allow Office Online to convert those documents to modern formats like docx, pptx, and xlsx to edit them in Office Online.</p>
        <p>However, the conversion process is not always perfect. Be aware that the conversion process can introduce changes to the layout and formatting of the document and that the conversion process may not support all legacy options. For example, legacy format .doc files with digital signatures may not be converted properly.</p>
