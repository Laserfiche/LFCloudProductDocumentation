        <h1>Using Import Agent and Email Archive </h1>
        <p>Import Agent is a tool for automatically retrieving files stored in a Windows folder and importing them into a Laserfiche repository. The Windows folder can be local  to the Import Agent machine or stored on a network drive. During the import process, Import Agent can process the files (e.g., perform OCR), add metadata (e.g., populate fields, add tags), and perform additional tasks. The Windows folder that files are retrieved from is referred to as the monitored directory. If a file is found in this folder it will be imported into a repository. After a file is imported to Laserfiche, the source file can either be deleted or moved to another Windows folder. If a file cannot be imported into Laserfiche, it will be moved to an alternate Windows folder.</p>
        <p>Import Agent also includes support for automatically archiving emails. Emails can be archived to specific locations based on various conditions, and can assign metadata to the messages and save email attachments.</p>
