        <h1>Importing Files</h1>
        <p>You can add any file on your computer to Laserfiche by importing it. This allows you to store all your content in one place. You can also import files saved in Google Drive, OneDrive, or OneDrive for Business directly into Laserfiche.</p>
        <p>When you import image files, they will be made into pages in a Laserfiche document, which allows you to use Laserfiche annotations with them. When you import non-image files, such as Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, or Photoshop projects, they will remain in their original formats. When you import a PDF, it will be converted to pages that you can annotate, but your original PDF will be retained in the document as well. </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b>&#160;If you want to convert an imported file that is not an image or a PDF to pages, you can do so using <a href="Snapshot.htm#Snapshot/Snapshot_Overview.htm">Snapshot</a>. If you want to scan paper documents, or perform image processing on already-scanned documents before importing them, you can do so with <a href="Scanning.htm">Laserfiche Scanning</a>.</p>
        <p>When importing non-image files, including PDFs, Laserfiche will also automatically generate text from them to make them full-text searchable. (To generate text from image files, you should use Import Agent, or scan them with <a href="Scanning.htm">Laserfiche Scanning</a> and Universal Capture.)&#160;You can customize the document's name, as well as other metadata such as field values, tags, and locations. See <a href="Metadata.htm">Metadata</a> for more information.</p>
        <p>You can import using the Import command, or by dragging and dropping.</p><iframe width="100%" height="557" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/importing/Importing+Documents.html"></iframe>
