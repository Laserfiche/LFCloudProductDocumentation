        <h1>Importing a Briefcase</h1>
        <p>A briefcase is a special collection of Laserfiche documents, including their metadata, that can be exported and re-imported into your repository. Briefcases are useful for sharing documents with other sites that use Laserfiche, or for backing up a set of documents. A briefcase includes not only the documents themselves, but also their folder structure, and Laserfiche-specific information such as annotations and metadata.</p>
        <p>Briefcases are saved as files with the extension LFB.</p>
