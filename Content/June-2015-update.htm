        <h1>June 2015 Update for Laserfiche Cloud</h1>
        <p>The June 2015 update of Laserfiche Cloud includes many new features, as well as updates to existing features. These include a suite of records management features designed to make it easy for you to manage records throughout their life cycle, a native integration with DocuSign, and the ability to temporarily grant access to your repository for support purposes.</p>
        <p>You can watch an overview of the new features here:</p><iframe width="100%" height="557" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/June-2015-Update/What%27s+New+In+Cloud+-+June+2015.html"></iframe>
        <h2>Records Management</h2>
        <p>Laserfiche Cloud now includes support for records management features, which allow you to process records and record folders according to a life cycle, through creation, retrieval, storage, and disposition. Records Management information and actions have been incorporated into the main document viewer and folder browser, and are available in desktop, tablet, and mobile views. </p>
        <p>Records managers can define file plans and configure retention rules specific to their organization, and then view properties and status information for individual records and record folders in the new Records tab of the Metadata Pane. You can access this information in the Folder Browser or when viewing a record in the Document Viewer. The life-cycle timeline displays the record's history and disposition eligibility, and eligible actions such as cutoff, transfer, accession, and destruction can be performed directly on the timeline. 
Records managers can quickly generate reports of records currently eligible for cutoff, disposition, and vital record review through the Records Management quick access list. Disposition actions can then be performed directly from the report.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Administrators can configure records management retention schedules, cutoff instructions, cycle definitions, locations, and events in the <b>Records Management</b> section of <b>Repository Administration</b>. In the repository, records managers can view record information in the <b>Records</b> tab of the <b>Metadata Pane</b> from either the Folder Browser or the Document Viewer, can perform record searches in the <b>Advanced Search</b> dialog box, and can run reports to locate eligible records in the <b>Records Management quick access list</b>.</p>
        <h2>DocuSign</h2>
        <p>Laserfiche's DocuSign integration allows users to request DocuSign signatures on existing documents in Laserfiche, or store documents directly in Laserfiche once they have been signed. In addition, administrators can configure settings such as field mapping and storage location to automatically capture information about signed documents.</p>
        <p>Administrators can configure DocuSign settings in the <b>Integrations</b> section of <b>Repository Administration</b>, and users can request signatures by selecting any document in the repository and choosing <b>Request Signature with DocuSign</b> from the <b>More</b> menu.</p>
        <h2>Audit Trail</h2>
        <p>Laserfiche Audit Trail Reporting has had a significant look-and-feel update, providing a more modern user interface and streamlining the process of creating and viewing reports. </p>
        <p>You can view the new Audit Trail Reporting interface by opening <b>Audit Reports</b>.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Security Tags</h2>
        <p>The support for metadata tags has been expanded to include security tags. When creating a tag, an administrator can designate it as a security tag, which can then be both applied to documents and granted to users. Once a security tag has been applied to a document, only those users who have been granted that tag will be able to see that document in Laserfiche.</p>
        <p>You can specify that a tag should be a security tag in the <b>Tags</b> section of <b>Repository Administration</b>, and grant a tag to a user in the <b>Users/Groups</b> section. To apply a tag to a document, select or open the document; tags can be applied in the main tab of the <b>Metadata Pane</b>.</p>
        <h2>Exporting Folders and Exporting Folder List Contents</h2>
        <p>Laserfiche Cloud now includes additional options for exporting the contents of your repository. You can now export a folder, which will also export the contents of the folder and its subfolders. You can also export a folder's list contents, which will generate a report of the contents of that folder but not export the contents themselves. If you export a folder's list contents, you can choose which metadata and document properties you want to include in the report.</p>
        <p>To export a folder or a folder's list contents, select the folder and open the <b>More</b> menu, then point to <b>Export</b> and select the export type you want.</p>

        </p>
        <h2>Grant Support Personnel Temporary Access To Your Account</h2>
        <p>During certain troubleshooting scenarios, it may become necessary to grant a support engineer access to your Laserfiche Cloud resources. Laserfiche Cloud customer accounts include a built-in system account named <b>SupportUser</b>. This system account is designed to allow your Solution Provider temporary access to your Laserfiche Cloud resources.</p>
        <p>The <b>SupportUser</b> account differs from standard users in that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There is a time limit associated with the account. Grant access to your Laserfiche resources only for the duration that you specify. You can disable the account at any time before the time limit is up.</li>
            <li>There is an <b>Allow administrative access</b> option that grants the ability to sign in to Laserfiche Account Administration and create additional administrative accounts and modify user properties.</li>
            <li>Standard user properties like <b>Email</b> and <b>Group</b> are permanently disabled. You can still assign a password to the account.</li>
            <li>You cannot delete the account. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Provide your Solution Provider's support contact with the <b>SupportUser</b> password to allow them access to your Laserfiche Cloud account.</p>
        <p>When viewing the properties of <b>SupportUser</b>, look for the <b>Grant access</b> check box.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h2>Marking Users As Inactive</h2>
        <p>Administrators can now mark users as inactive in <b>Account Administration</b>. Inactive users cannot sign in to Laserfiche and do not count against the user limit.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/disable.png" />
        </p>
        <h2>Additional Updates and Enhancements</h2>
        <p>The June release of Laserfiche Cloud includes several additional updates and enhancements to functionality and to the user interface. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accessibility support has been improved to make it easier for users who rely on screen readers and other accessibility tools to work in Laserfiche. </li>
            <li>When performing a quick search, users can restrict the search to the current folder and its subfolders, allowing them to find a document even more quickly if they know what part of the repository it's in. To do so, select the dropdown to the left of the <b>Quick Search</b> bar and select <b>Within current folder</b>.</li>
            <li>You can now email documents directly from Laserfiche and Laserfiche Mobile using Amazon Simple Email Service.</li>
        </ul>
