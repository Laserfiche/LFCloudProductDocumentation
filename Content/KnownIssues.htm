        <h1>Known Issues</h1>
        <p>This topic lists out some of the current known issues that can affect visitors to Laserfiche Cloud. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>In some cases, when installing the Office Integration, the installer will display the error message "Installation failed. The system may not be able to roll back the installation automatically" even though the installation was successfully completed. If you receive this error message, close and re-open your browser; in most cases, the Office Integration will load successfully.</li>
            <li>In some cases, if you type a URL&#160;to a Cloud repository without including the final slash in the URL&#160;(i.e., https://webaccess.laserfiche.com/laserfiche rather than https://webaccess.laserfiche.com/laserfiche/), your browser will display a "Server Error in /Laserfiche Application"&#160;error message. To resolve this issue, select the URL&#160;bar in your browser and press the ENTER&#160;key. (Refreshing the page using the F5 key or the Refresh button will not resolve this issue.)</li>
