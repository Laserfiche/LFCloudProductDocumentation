        <h1>Links</h1>
        <p>A link is a metadata type in Laserfiche that allows you to connect two related documents or folders, such as an email and an document. 
Links use a word or phrase of description to help you categorize your documents and keep track of related documents. For example, you might connect documents of different types that are related in some way, such as an agenda and its packet or an email message and its document. You might also use document relationships to indicate document status, such as a document that has been superseded and the document that superseded it.</p>
