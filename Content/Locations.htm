        <h1>Locations</h1>
        <p>Locations allow you to add a map location to a document or folder in Laserfiche. When an entry has a location set, users can view the location, and can perform searches for documents near a specific location. For example, maintenance requests might be stored with locations indicating the property that needs maintenance; when a worker goes to perform the maintenance, they could search for all properties in a particular vicinity that have open maintenance requests.</p>
        <p>A location has two parts: the location itself, and a location description. By default, the location description is the street address of the location; you can also modify it (for instance, to provide a building or landmark name). You can add a location to an entry by specifying a location, or by dragging and dropping a pin. In addition, when importing .JPG files, Laserfiche will include the file's EXIF data, including any geolocation information, which will be included as a location. This allows you to quickly include location information taken from photos.</p>
        <p>You can search for entries based on their location data. See <a href="Advanced_Search.htm">Search Filters</a> and <a href="Search_Syntax.htm">Search Syntax</a> for more information.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Adding and Editing Map Location&#160;Data</h2>
        <p>You can view the current location for an entry, view the map, or open a link to edit the location data from the details pane in the document viewer and folder browser.</p>
        <p>Viewing a document's location requires the Read entry access right. Adding or modifying location data requires the <b>Write Metadata</b> entry access right.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> If you are importing a JPG file with location data in the EXIF information, the location will be added automatically upon import. You can also assign a location to any file type at the time of import. See <a href="Importing_Files.htm">Importing Files</a> for more information.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a document or folder in the folder browser, or open a document in the document viewer.</li>
            <li>Select the <b>Details</b> tab. The current location, if any, will be listed under <b>Location</b>. To view the map itself in the details pane, select <b>Show Map</b>.</li>
            <li>To add, modify, or remove a location, perform one of the following:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If the entry does not yet have location data, select <b>Add</b>.</li>
                <li>If the entry has location data, select the location.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The <b>Edit Location</b> dialog box will open. To specify a location, type the address in the address box. If a location already exists, or once you have placed a location, you can modify it by selecting and dragging the red location marker to a new position.</li>
            <li>Optionally, name your location in the <b>Description</b> option. If you do not name your location, the address will be used instead.</li>
            <li>To remove a location entirely, select <b>Clear Location</b>.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Save</b> to save your changes.</li>
