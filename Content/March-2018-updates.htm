        <h1>March 2018 Updates for Laserfiche Cloud</h1>
        <p>The March 2018 update for Laserfiche Cloud includes many new features, as well as updates to existing features.</p>
        <p>Watch an overview of the new features here:<iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/New-Features-in-Cloud-March-2018/New-Features-in-Cloud-March-2018_player.html"></iframe></p>
        <h2>Document Updates</h2>
        <p><b>Folder Browser Filtering</b>
        </p>
        <p>You can now filter a list of entries in the folder browser when viewing folder contents. This allows you to quickly find relevant documents from a large folder or set of search results. Most columns can be filtered, and the filter options are tailored to the column type. For example, you could filter a folder’s contents to display only documents with a particular word or phrase in the name, or only documents created during a certain date range, or with a specific template assigned to them. You can also filter on field values, and apply multiple filters to more precisely pinpoint the documents you need.</p>
        <p><b>Group-Based Settings</b>
        </p>
        <p>Administrators can now create saved searches, quick searches, column profiles, and import profiles and share them with specific groups, or with the Everyone group. These settings will be available to all members of the group. These shared settings will not override a user’s individual settings; instead, users will see both their own settings and the settings for all the groups that they belong to.</p>
        <p><b>Drag and Drop Between Browser Windows</b>
        </p>
        <p>You can now drag and drop entries in Laserfiche from one browser window to another. This allows you to easily move documents between folders, even if the folders are in different parts of the repository.</p>
        <p><b>Multi-Value Field Group Names</b>
        </p>
        <p>Multi-value field groups allow administrators to group multi-value fields that are related to each other. You can now give names to your multi-value field groups. For instance, you might want to store contact information for multiple people in a template, with each person having a name, email address, and phone number. You could group all three multi-value fields together so that you can easily see which phone number and email address is associated with each user, and then provide the multi-value field group name “Contacts.” Each set of name, phone number, and email address will be collected under the “Contacts” header, and numbered as “1 of 3,” “2 of 3,” and so on.</p>
        <p><b>Localized Field, Templates, and Tag Names</b>
        </p>
        <p>Administrators can use the new Language tab when viewing template, field, and tag properties to configure translated display names for template names, field names, and tags. When a user views Laserfiche in a particular language, Laserfiche will display the configured display names within the metadata pane instead of the original template name, field name, or tag.</p>
        <p><b>Effective Entry Access Rights Calculation</b>
        </p>
        <p>The Effective Rights tab of the Access Rights dialog box now includes detailed rights inheritance information for specific rights. This allows you to easily troubleshoot security by providing information on why a particular right has been allowed or denied.</p>
        <p><b>Document Viewer and Preview Pane Enhancements</b>
        </p>
        <p>The document viewer and the folder browser preview pane have been updated with several new enhancements to make working with and navigating documents easier.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved navigation in the document viewer. For example, next and previous document, and next and previous page—have been placed on the toolbar to make it easier for users to quickly move within and between documents.</li>
            <li>Document viewer toolbar customization. All document actions are available in the toolbar and can be customized.</li>
            <li>Reorderable metadata tabs. Users can now customize the order of tabs in the details pane. For instance, by default the processes tab is listed before the records tab, but a records manager could rearrange the tabs to display the records tab first. Their settings will apply to tabs in the details pane of both the document viewer and the folder browser.</li>
            <li>Email content view. Laserfiche now provides an easy way to view the text of emails in MSG or EML format, without needing to open the email file in its native application. This view is available in both the preview tab of the details pane, and in the document viewer.</li>
            <li>Search in the preview pane. Within-document searches can now be performed in the preview tab of the folder browser’s details pane.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Redaction Reasons</b>
        </p>
        <p>Repository Administration now allows administrators to define a set of redaction reasons. When applying a redaction, users can choose from the list of predefined reasons. The selected reason will be visible to all users when viewing the document.</p>
        <p><b>Other Enhancements</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Support for emails in EML format. Email-specific features, previously only supported for emails in MSG format, are now available for emails in EML format as well.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Copy Document and Folder URLs</b>
        </p>
        <p>Laserfiche now allows you to easily copy the URL of a document or folder from within the folder browser.</p>
        <h2>Laserfiche App Updates</h2>
        <p><b>Face and Touch ID on iOS</b>
        </p>
        <p>When using an iOS device, users can choose to use Face ID or Touch ID to sign in to the Laserfiche app. This offers a quick and convenient way to sign into Laserfiche without entering a username or password.</p>
        <p><b>Offline Drafts</b>
        </p>
        <p>Users can start a task or form online, save it as a draft, then save the draft offline to continue working while on the go, without internet or cellular service. Offline task drafts can also be renamed to prevent overwriting information on task drafts previously saved offline. Additionally, a new Sync option allows changes to online and offline repository documents and folders, as well as changes to task and form drafts, to be automatically or manually synced.</p>
        <p><b>Search Features</b>
        </p>
        <p>The search pane has been updated to be more intuitive and uniform across multiple platforms. Users can now search on specific field values as well as set up and save search criteria. iOS users can use Spotlight search, Windows users can use Cortana search, and Android users can use the Personal Content search to search for offline documents by name or document text; offline forms, drafts, and tasks by name; and offline drafts and submissions by name and field values.</p>
        <p><b>Metadata, Versions, and Document Links</b>
        </p>
        <p>Users can now access and work with a document or folder's metadata in a single pane. Additionally, documents can be linked and users can now view, revert, and delete document versions all within the Metadata pane in the app.</p>
        <p><b>Annotations</b>
        </p>
        <p>There have been a variety of updates to annotations in the Laserfiche app. The way in which annotations are applied to documents has been redesigned for a better user experience. In addition to adding sticky notes, stamps, and freehand annotations to documents, you can now also add highlights, redactions, underlines, and strikethrough annotations to documents and text.</p>
        <p><b>Drag and Drop on iOS</b>
        </p>
        <p>You can now drag files to and from Laserfiche using the new drag and drop feature on the iPad Pro. For example, you can open the iOS email app and drag a Laserfiche document from the Laserfiche app to the email app. Alternatively, you can drag and drop photos, emails, email attachments, or documents from third party apps into the Laserfiche app.</p>
        <p><b>Real-Time Auto Cropping on iOS and Android</b>
        </p>
        <p>When taking a picture to add as a new document, a new Document mode automatically detects the document and will auto-crop it before you snap and upload the picture to Laserfiche. This minimizes time spent manually cropping the document in preparation for upload.</p>
        <p><b>Share iOS Notes</b>
        </p>
        <p>Notes written in the Notes app on iOS devices can be shared to Laserfiche. The text, images, and sketches inside the note will be uploaded as separate electronic files.</p>
        <h2>Public Portal Updates</h2>
        <p><b>Improved Public Portal Website</b>
        </p>
        <p>The public portal website has been updated, providing a more responsive design and a more modern feel. For example, document thumbnails can now be viewed when browsing documents.</p>
        <p><b>Search Forms</b>
        </p>
        <p>The Public Portal Designer includes a new search form designer. Create search forms to create custom searches based on the information your public portal users are looking for. The search box on the Welcome Page can search text, entry names, fields, and/or annotation text. For example, create a search form that only searches for documents in a specific folder or documents assigned to a specific template. You could also create a search form that allowed users to quickly perform a search for documents created during a particular timeframe.</p>
