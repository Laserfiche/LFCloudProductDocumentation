        <h1>Capturing Documents with Laserfiche Snapshot</h1>
        <p>Laserfiche Snapshot is a virtual printer that allows you to "print"&#160;electronic documents into your repository as image pages. In effect, Laserfiche Snapshot works as though you had printed the document and then scanned it back into Laserfiche, but allows you to skip the step of making a physical printed copy. This allows you to create documents with pages that you can review and annotate within Laserfiche.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b>&#160;When capturing a document with Snapshot, only the pages will be retained, not the original file itself. &#160;If you want to keep the file, you can <a href="Importing.htm">import</a> it instead.</p>
        <p>Snapshot can capture any electronic file that supports printing in its native application. For each Snapshot capture, you can configure the paper size, color format, and other properties 
 used to generate pages. You can also set metadata for the documents when you capture them. In addition, Snapshot automatically generates text from your documents, which means they will be text-searchable in the repository.</p>
        <p>Once you have installed Snapshot on a particular computer, it will automatically be listed among your printers in the Print dialog of applications on that computer.</p>
        <h2>Printing to Your Repository with Laserfiche Snapshot</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the document you want to capture in its native application.</li>
            <li>Open the application's print dialog.</li>
            <li>In the list of printers, select Laserfiche Snapshot. Configure print options in your application and then begin printing.</li>
            <li>Laserfiche Snapshot will launch and prompt you to provide your Laserfiche server, repository, user name, and password.</li>
            <li>In the <b>Document Properties</b> tab, specify the document name in the Name option. By default, this will be the file name of the document you are printing.</li>
            <li>In the <b>Save to Repository</b> option, specify the destination folder in the <b>Folder</b> option. You can use the token button (<b>&gt;</b>) to dynamically set this based on document properties, and the browse button (<b>...</b>)&#160;to browse to a location.</li>
            <li>In the <b>Template</b> option, you can modify the template and field information for your new document. See <a href="Fields_and_Templates.htm">Fields</a> for more information.</li>
            <li>In the <b>Tags</b> tab, you can add tags to the document. See <a href="Tags.htm">Tags</a> for more information.</li>
            <li>In the <b>Document Handling</b> tab, you can specify how to handle name conflicts when creating the document.</li>
            <li>In the <b>Text</b> tab, you can determine whether to generate searchable text directly from the file, or to perform an OCR process to generate text. In general, we recommend selecting <b>Obtain text from the print job</b>, as this usually produces the most accurate results. </li>
            <li>Click <b>OK</b>&#160;to print the document to the repository.</li>
        </ol>
