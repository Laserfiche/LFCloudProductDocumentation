        <h1>Emailing Links to Documents and Folders
</h1>
        <p>       You can email mobile URLs to documents and folders that other users can open using Laserfiche Mobile and Laserfiche. </p>
        <p><b>To email a link to a document or folder</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>If using an Android device, long press the entry you want to email a link to. If using an Apple device, swipe left on the entry you want to email a link to. If you want to email links to multiple documents or folders, tap the checkboxes next to the entries and tap the More button <img src="Images/More.png" style="width: 27px;height: 27px;" /> in the top right. </li>
            <p class="ex"><b>Tip:</b> If you already have the document that you want to send a link to open, tap the More button <img src="Images/More.png" style="width: 29px;height: 29px;" /> in the top right.</p>
            <li>Tap <b>Email Link</b>.</li>
            <li>A list of the apps on your phone that can send email might appear. Optionally, before selecting an email app, select if you want to use this app by default each time you email a link to a mobile document. Tap the email app you want to use. </li>
            <li>The email application will open and an email will be populated containing one or more links. The  links the email contains depends on what has been configured by your administrator. The email can be configured to have:<ul><li>A link for opening the document or folder using Laserfiche, beginning with <b>http://</b>. </li><li>A  link  for opening the document or folder using Laserfiche Mobile, beginning with <b>lfmobile://</b>.</li><li>Links to download the app in the Google Play or iTunes App Store.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Edit the email as desired. </li>
            <li>Send the email. </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> By default, when sending a document URL, the URL in the email will be configured to display imaged pages if any are available. If no imaged pages are available, the electronic document will open in your device's default application for that type of document.  PDFs will open in the Laserfiche Mobile app. A document's text will only open when it’s the only thing that exists for that document. If using an Android device, you will be promoted to choose an application to open the documents with PDFs.</p>
