        <h1>Field Types
        </h1>
        <p>The way in which you enter field information depends on the type of field you are working with. The possible field types that can be configured by your administrator are listed below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Text, number, or data field:</b> A keyboard will be displayed. If using an Apple device, after entering a field value, tap the <b>Go</b> button to hide the keyboard. If using an Android device, tap the return key to hide the keyboard.</li>
            <li><b>Date, time, or date/time field:</b> A dialog box will be displayed where you can choose the desired date or time.  When finished, tap <b>Set</b>.<p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The date's format will reflect your system settings.</p></li>
            <li><b>List field:</b> A list of available options appear when you tap the field. To select an item, tap it, or tap <b>Cancel</b> to close the list without selecting an item. </li>
            <li><b>Multi-value field:</b> The <b>Add</b> link will appear under the field. Tap this link to add another value to the field. Tap the delete button <img src="Images/DeleteButton.png" style="width: 30px;height: 31px;" /> to remove added fields.</li>
            <li><b>Required fields:</b> An asterisk * next to a field denotes that you must fill out the field before saving the document. </li>
            <li><b>Geotag field:</b> You may see a geotag field  added to your documents. Administrators can configure every new photo taken and uploaded as a new document to have a geotag field applied to it. This geotag will contain the coordinates of the location the photo was taken  (e.g., 33.8212,-118.1897).  If the document is composed of multiple photos taken in different locations, the coordinates for the first photo in the document will be recorded.  You must have <a href="Location_Services.htm">Location Services</a> enabled in order to create and upload new documents requiring the geotag field.</li>
        </ul>
