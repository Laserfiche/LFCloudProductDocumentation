        <h1>Recent Uploads</h1>
        <p>Depending on your connection speed, uploading to Laserfiche may take some time. The <b>Recent Uploads</b> option lets you see the documents that are currently uploading and that have been uploaded in the last seven days. If no documents have been uploaded in that time frame, the list will show the last ten documents uploaded.</p>
        <p> If your device loses Internet connection, uploads will automatically pause and will resume as soon as the connection is regained.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">To view and open recent uploads</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Swipe  right and tap <b>Recent Uploads.</b> Or, tap the main menu button <img src="Images/Menu.PNG" style="width: 23px;height: 20px;" /> in the top left, and tap <b>Recent Uploads</b>.</li>
            <li>Documents that have been successfully uploaded will have a blue check mark  next to them (Android only). Documents that are in the process of uploading will have an uploading icon  next to them and their progress  below them (Android and Apple).</li>
            <li>From this screen you can tap the document to open it. If it has not uploaded completely, a warning will appear before it opens. </li>
