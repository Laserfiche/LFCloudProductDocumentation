        <h1>Navigating the Repository</h1>
        <p>There are four major parts of the Laserfiche repository:&#160;the repository itself, which contains your documents and folders; the repository administration page, where you configure options such as users and groups, security, metadata, records management, and activity monitoring, among others; and audit trail, where you configure audit settings and run audit reports. You can also use additional tools to work with your repository contents, including the Laserfiche mobile app, capture tools such as Snapshot and Import Agent, and the public portal.</p>
        <p>When you first sign in to Laserfiche, your starting page will depend on your account type, account settings, and the URL&#160;you used to access the repository. You can switch to other apps in Laserfiche using the app picker (<img src="Resources/Images/app-picker.png" />)&#160;in the upper right corner next to your user name. You can also change your default starting page; see <a href="default-application.htm">Setting a Default Application</a> for more information.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Laserfiche Repository</h2>
        <p>Your repository contains the documents and folders in Laserfiche. To open your repository, open the app picker and select your repository name in the <b>Repository</b> section.</p>
        <p>The repository itself has two main sections:&#160;the Folder Browser and the Document Viewer.</p>
        <h3 class="topicheading">Folder Browser</h3>
        <p>When you log in to the repository, you will begin in the Folder Browser. You can navigate your repository quickly using the folder tree on the left. To view the contents of a folder, you can select it and view the documents it contains in the center. You can also select individual documents and folders in the center. You can perform actions by clicking the buttons on the toolbar at the upper right, or by right-clicking a document or folder. (For instance, you can click the Scan button to scan a new document, or select a document and click the Download button, or right-click it and select Download, to download it.) On the right, you can view additional information (called metadata) about the selected document or folder. </p>
        <p>You can also perform a quick search by typing search terms in the search bar at the top, or click <b>Search Filters</b> to configure a search using a wider variety of options. </p>
        <p>Starred documents and folders, recently-opened documents, and the results of your most recent search can be accessed in the upper left corner; your recycle bin is in the lower left corner, beneath the folder tree.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="Adding_Content.htm">Adding Documents and Folders</a>, <a href="Viewing_Documents.htm">Viewing Documents and Folders</a>, and <a href="Organizing_Documents.htm">Organizing Documents and Folders</a>.</p><iframe width="100%" height="557" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/Folder-Browser-20201/Folder-Browser-20201.html"></iframe>
        <h3 class="topicheading">Document Viewer</h3>
        <p>The Document Viewer allows you to view the pages, metadata, annotations, and other information about documents with image pages, including PDFs. You can also open Microsoft Word, Excel, or PowerPoint documents for viewing and editing, or stream video and audio files. (Other types of documents will be downloaded for opening in their native application by default.)</p>
        <p>On the left, you can quickly scan through a document's pages using the thumbnails. To view a page, select it and it will display in the center. On the right, you can view additional information (called metadata) about the selected document or folder. The toolbar at the top allows you to perform actions such as zooming in or out, adding annotations, switching to full screen mode, or saving changes. Above that, the search bar allows you to quickly search within this document.</p>
        <p> For more information, see <a href="Viewing_Documents.htm">Viewing Documents and Folders</a> and <a href="Working_with_Doc_Contents.htm">Working with Document Contents</a>.</p><iframe width="100%" height="557" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/Laserfiche-Document-Viewer-104/Document-Viewer-104.html"></iframe>
        <h3 class="topicheading">Scanning</h3>
        <p>Laserfiche Scanning allows you to use a scanner to 
capture paper documents and store them in Laserfiche. You can also use Laserfiche Scanning to import images already on your computer. While scanning, you can perform image enhancements such as rotating or deskewing a page, generate text from the scanned documents, and store additional information about the documents along with them. </p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="Scanning.htm">Scanning</a>.</p>
        <h3 class="topicheading">Office Integration</h3>
        <p>Office Integration is a Laserfiche component that allows users to take advantage of Laserfiche features when working with Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and Outlook messages in their native Microsoft Office applications. Office Integration allows you to save Office files directly to your repository from the Office ribbon or toolbar, and to make changes to a document's metadata without leaving Office. For more information, see <a href="Saving_from_Office.htm">Saving to Laserfiche from Microsoft Office</a>, <a href="Sending_from_Outlook.htm">Sending Emails to Laserfiche from Microsoft Office</a>, <a href="Working_with_Doc_Contents.htm#Working">Working with Microsoft Office Documents</a>, and <a href="Printing_and_Exporting.htm#Attachin">Attaching a Laserfiche Document in Outlook</a>.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Repository Administration</h2>
        <p>Repository Administration allows you to configure settings for your repository, set security, create user-defined metadata types, and manage repository activity.&#160;You can use the links at the left to select the repository settings you want to configure. The actual settings will open in the center of the screen.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="Security.htm">Security</a>,&#160;<a href="Metadata.htm">Metadata</a>, and <a href="Records-Management.htm">Records Management</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="topicheading">Audit Reports</h2>
        <p>If you have chosen to audit actions in your repository, you can use Audit Reports to view that information. You can create reports to analyze audit data, view the information as a chart, filter it to include only the information relevant to you, and export the data for use in spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft Excel. If you are in another section of your repository, you can quickly switch to Audit Reports by clicking your user name in the top right corner and selecting <b>Audit Reports</b>. For more information, see <a href="Auditing.htm">Auditing</a>.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Laserfiche Mobile</h2>
        <p>While Laserfiche is available directly from your phone's web browser, you can also install the Laserfiche Mobile app for iOS or Android. Laserfiche Mobile includes much of the same functionality available in the browser version of Laserfiche, and also allows you to upload documents directly from your camera's phone or photo gallery, along with better support for printing and exporting from your phone. For more information, see <a href="Mobile/Laserfiche_Mobile_Cloud.htm">Accessing Laserfiche on Mobile Devices</a>.</p>

        <p>  Laserfiche Snapshot creates pages and text files from electronic files (e.g., a Word document, a Web page, a text editor, etc.) and to store the resulting documents in Laserfiche.
