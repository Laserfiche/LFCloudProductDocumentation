        <h1>Organizing Documents and Folders</h1>
        <p>You can organize your documents and folders to make them easier to find. You can create folders to contain documents, move and copy documents and folders, add shortcuts to link a document or folder from another folder, and rename documents and folders.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Creating"></a>Creating Folders</h2>
        <p>In addition to adding documents to your repository, you can also create folders to organize those documents.&#160;See <a href="Creating_Folders.htm#Creating">Creating Folders</a> for more information.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Starred Documents and Folders, Recent Documents, and Documents in Use</h2>
        <p>Laserfiche offers several ways to quickly locate documents. You can star documents and folders for quick access later on, view a list of documents that you recently opened, and access a list of all the documents that you currently have checked out. See <a href="Starred_Recent_In_Use.htm">Starred Documents, Recent Documents and Documents in Use</a> for more information.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Moving"></a>Moving Documents and Folders</h2>
        <p>You can move a folder in one of two ways:&#160;by dragging and dropping, or using the <b>Move To</b> command. To move a document or folder by dragging and dropping, select one or more and drag them to the location you want to place it in, whether in the current folder or in the folder tree to the left. To move a document or folder using the <b>Move or Copy To</b> dialog box, select the document and then select <b>Move or Copy To</b>. Select <b>Move</b>, and then navigate to the folder to which you want to copy the document. Select <b>Save</b>.</p>

        <p>By default, copying a document or folder will also copy security set directly on that document. You can disable this if you do not want security to be copied. To do so, click your user name in the upper right corner and select <b>Options</b>. In the <b>General</b> section, clear the option <b>Copy access rights along with the entries</b>. </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>:&#160;You can also copy a set of folders and then paste only the folders, not the documents within them. For more information, see <a href="Creating_Folders.htm#Creating">Creating Folders</a>.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Creating Shortcuts</h2>
