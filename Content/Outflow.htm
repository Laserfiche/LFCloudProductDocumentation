            <MadCap:concept term="Forms" />Outflow</h1>
        <p>Outflow settings let you specify when a particular pathway in your process should run. For example, after a <a href="activities.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">user task</a> in which a manager approves or denies a form, outflow settings let you designate one course of action for an approved form and another course for a denied form. </p>
        <p>Once a gateway is connected to other objects in the process model, its outflow settings will appear in its settings window. Tasks also have outflow settings in the <b>Outflow</b> tab of its settings window.</p>
        <li>A task or gateway's Outflow settings are shown in a table that lists each destination object the task or gateway is connected to. </li>

        <ul>
            <li>In the <b>Name</b> column, you can edit the name of the sequence flow (the line that connects the object to a following object). </li>
            <li>In the <b>Path Conditions</b> column, you can specify conditions that must be met for that particular outflow path to be taken. When you click in the field, the Conditional Expression Builder will open, which you can use to create an expression. Or, if you know XPath, you can enter conditions directly into the text box. </li>
            <li>To set an outflow path as the default, select the appropriate  <b>This is the default outflow path</b> checkbox.</li>
