        <h1>Creating a Process Diagram</h1>
        <p>In the Process Modeler, you can build and configure the selected process using objects. </p>
        <p class="ex"><b>Tip:</b> Before you begin, be sure you understand the business process well enough to translate it into the appropriate objects. Much of the difficulty in designing a business process comes from a lack of knowledge about how the process works or about how to use BPMN. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Three types of objects are used to represent business processes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="../../Events.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Events</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="Activities.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Activities</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="Activities.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Gateways</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The palette on the left in the Process Modeler shows all available objects for building your process, broken down into these three categories. Click the links above for more information about each object type. Once you're familiar with these objects, follow the steps below to learn how to build a business process with them.</p>
        <p>At the most basic level, a business process must have a start event and an end event. For this reason, these objects are present on the canvas by default for all processes.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Sub-processes do not need a start or end event.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Sign in to Laserfiche and use the application picker or the Overview page and select Forms.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Manage</b>.</li>
            <li>Click <b>New process</b> (<img src="Resources/Images/newprocessbutton.png" />) and select from one of the basic templates to create a new process.</li>
            <li>Ensure your process has a <b>start event</b>. If one is not present on the canvas, drag one of the <b>Start Event</b> types onto the canvas. </li>
            <li>Drag an object from the palette to add it to the canvas. Connect one object to another using  <MadCap:glossaryTerm>Sequence Flows</MadCap:glossaryTerm>.</li>
            <li>Repeat the previous step with various objects until your business process is fully represented on the canvas with objects correctly connected to each other.</li>
            <p class="ex"><b>Tip:</b> To quickly add an object that needs to be similar to an existing object, right-click the object and select copy. Make any necessary changes to the new object.</p>
            <li>Configure events, activities, and gateways used in your process by double-clicking them and opening their settings.</li>
            <li>As you build out your process, you can zoom and pan the canvas. Additionally, you can view the process as an image by clicking the <b>View Process Image</b> (<img src="Resources/Images/viewprocessimagetoolbarbutton.png" />) toolbar button.</li>
            <li>When you are finished configuring your business process, click the validate (<img src="Resources/Images/validateButton.png" alt="Validate button" title="Click this button to check for errors" />) toolbar button  to check for any errors in your process. If present, errors will be displayed in a pop-up warning message.</li>
            <li>Resolve any errors, and click <b>Save</b> to save the business process.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> After building a process in the Process Designer, you must publish it before the process can be used.</p>
