        <h1>Records Management Administration</h1>
        <p>Certain administrative configuration is necessary before you can begin creating and managing records. You will need to ensure that your records managers have the correct rights to perform records management actions, and you will need to create the relevant records management instructions and definitions (such as retention schedules and cutoff instructions)&#160;that will be used to govern records.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Records Management Security</h2>
        <p>There are several rights that are specific to records management:&#160;the Records Management privilege, and several records management-specific entry access rights. In addition, records managers must have all other relevant rights to view record information. </p>
        <h3 class="topicheading">Records Management Privilege</h3>
        <p>The Records Management privilege allows records managers to create records management definition such as retention schedules and cutoff instructions in Repository Administration, and perform record actions such as cutoff and final disposition in the repository. This privilege does not bypass other forms of security; users must still have other appropriate rights to view and modify records. (Users without this privilege can still view and modify record contents such as pages and metadata, and view but not modify record properties such as life cycle status, as long as they have sufficient other rights.)</p>
        <p>Retention schedules, cutoff instructions, events, cycle definitions, and locations must be created in Repository Administration before they can be applied to record series, record folders, and records.</p>
        <h3 class="topicheading">Records Management Entry Access Rights</h3>
        <p>Records management operations that are not controlled by the Records 
 Management privilege are controlled through four entry access 
 rights: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Set Last Review Date:</b> Set, unset, or modify the review date on a vital record. </li>
            <li><b>Close/Reopen Folder
:</b> Close and reopen record folders, and file new records into closed record folders.</li>
            <li><b>Add/Remove Hold:</b> Add and remove holds on entries. </li>
            <li><b>Set Event Time:</b> Set, unset, or modify the event date on a record 
 folder.  Set, unset, or modify the alternate retention event date. 
		</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Records Management Entry Access Rights and Basic Laserfiche Security</b>
        </p>
        <p>In addition to records management entry access rights, standard 
 Laserfiche security rules still apply. If users are unable to see a record, 
 they will be unable to perform records management actions on that record. Users must have the Browse  and Read entry access rights on 
 a record folder or record to perform any records management functions 
 on it.</p>
        <p>For more information, see <a href="Security.htm">Security</a>.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Records Management Instructions and Definitions</h2>
        <p>In Repository Administration, you can set up retention schedules, cutoff instructions, events, cycle definitions , and locations that are used to govern records in your repository.</p>
        <h3 class="topicheading"><a name="Retentio"></a>Retention Schedules</h3>
        <p>Records enter 
 their retention period after they are cutoff. A retention schedule is a collection of rules, usually dictated by compliance regulations, that governs how records 
 are to be stored and for how long. </p>
        <p>Retention schedules are created and defined in repository administration and are applied to record series, record folders, or individual records in the repository itself. You must be assigned the Records Management privilege to create, modify, and apply retention schedules.</p>
        <p><b>Metadata retention</b>
        </p>
        <p>When configuring retention schedules, you can select to retain record's metadata information after the record is removed from the Laserfiche repository. This means that the record's images, text, and electronic 
 files will be removed from the repository, but field values, 
 records management state, and other metadata (with the exception of version history)&#160;are retained. Metadata is retained by default, and should not be deleted unless there is a valid reason to do so, since it also proves the records were retained correctly even after they are destroyed.</p>
        <p><b>The retention schedule defines the following:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How long records must be retained.</li>
            <li>The order, duration, location, and 
 instructions for interim transfers.</li>
            <li>The final disposition of the records.</li>
            <li>The event or events that would trigger an alternate retention schedule, if applicable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>To create a retention schedule</b>
        </p>
        <p>Before creating a retention schedule, first create any <a href="#Locations">locations</a> and <a href="#Events">events</a> that will be used .</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If you are not already in the repository administration section of Laserfiche, click the grid icon (<img src="Resources/Images/grid_widget_icon.png" title="The grid button allows you to move between your documents and folders, Repository Administration, Account Administration, and Audit Reports." alt="The grid button, a three by three grid of white squares." />)&#160;in the upper right corner and select <b>Repository Administration</b>.					</li>
            <li>Select     <b>Records</b> on the left.</li>
            <li>Select the <b>Retention&#160;Schedules</b> tab.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>Add</b> button (<img src="Resources/Images/admin_add_button.png" alt="The Add button, a dark gray plus sign." title="The Add button allows you to add a new item." />).</li>
            <li>In the <b>General</b> 
					tab, enter a name and description. </li>
            <li>In the <b>Instructions</b> tab, specify 
					the initial retention period. </li>
            <li>Click <b>Add</b> if you want to insert transfer instructions as part of the retention schedule. Fill in the following:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Select a location for the transfer in the <b>Location</b> option of the <b>Transfers</b> table. If the transfer is within the current file area, select <b>Current file area</b>. (Locations other than <b>Current file area</b> must have already been defined in the repository. See <a href="#Locations">Locations</a> for more information.)</li>
                <li>In the <b>Retain (months)</b>&#160;option, select the number of months the record should be kept at this location.</li>
                <li>In the <b>Action</b> option, select <b>Retain all data</b> to keep all information when the record is stored at this location, <b>Retain metadata</b> to keep the metadata about the document but destroy the pages or electronic file, or <b>Destroy records</b> to destroy the entire record.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>In <b>Final disposition</b>, select the final disposition action for the retention schedule.</li>
            <li>If you selected <b>Accession</b> as the final disposition action, 
					choose the <b>Archival Location</b>. Note that you will not be able to select the current filing system as an archival location, because accession means you are transferring records management responsibility and authority for the records. (Locations  must have already been defined in the repository. See <a href="#Locations">Locations</a> for more information.)</li>
            <li>Select or clear the option to <b>Retain metadata</b> after performing the final disposition action. In general, we recommend that you retain your record metadata unless your compliance regulations require otherwise</li>
            <li>Click <b>OK</b> 
						to close the <b>New Retention Schedule</b> 
					dialog box and save the retention schedule.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="topicheading"><a name="Cutoff"></a>Cutoff Instructions</h3>
        <p>A cutoff instruction defines when a record folder or record will become eligible for cutoff, and therefore when its retention schedule will begin. Each type of cutoff instruction provides a different way of calculating cutoff eligibility , offering you a more flexible solution to managing your records. </p>
        <p>Laserfiche offers the following types of cutoff instructions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <MadCap:toggler targets="time" style="font-weight: bold;">Time</MadCap:toggler> </li>
            <div MadCap:targetName="time">
                <p> Time-based cutoff instructions cause records to become eligible for cutoff based on both a cycle definition (e.g., monthly or yearly)&#160;and the filing date of the record folder. The record becomes eligible for cutoff at the start of the next cycle following the record folder's filing date. Cutoff eligibility for time cutoff is calculated based on cycles 
				and not on an absolute time interval. If you want to use an absolute time interval, you can do so with the Interval cutoff instruction.</p>
                <p>Time cutoff allows record series or record folders from a specific time period to become eligible for cutoff at the same time so that records managers can group and cutoff all eligible entries at the same time. By default, the filing date is the creation date of the record folder, but it can be manually set to a different date (including future dates).</p>
                <div class="ex">
                    <MadCap:dropDown>

                            <p>If a Time cutoff instruction has a cycle of one month, records with this cutoff instruction will always be eligible for cutoff on the first day of the next month. On the other hand, if an Interval cutoff instruction is set to one month, records with this instruction will be eligible for cutoff exactly one month after the filing date (i.e. records filed on March 15 will be eligible for cutoff on April 15th).</p>

                <p>If a cutoff instruction only contains one event, the record folder will become eligible based on that event date. If a cutoff instruction contains multiple events, the administrator who configured the cutoff instruction can determine how the multiple events are handled: if <b>Cutoff eligibility requires all events</b> is selected, records are eligible when all event dates have been set and the final event date chronologically has passed (cutoff is based on the final event date); if <b>Cutoff eligibility requires any events is selected</b>, the record is eligible when at least one event date has been set and has passed (cutoff is based on the first event date set).	</p>

        <h3 class="topicheading"><a name="Cycle"></a>Cycle Definitions</h3>
        <p>Cycle definitions are used by Time and Time+Event cutoff instructions 
 to determine cutoff eligibility, as well as to determine 
 vital record review cycles. Laserfiche includes nine predefined cycle 
 definitions, which can be modified, and allows you to create new 
 definitions. Each cycle definition is composed of the following 
 properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Code</li>
            <li>Description</li>
            <li>Type of cycle</li>
            <li>Individual periods that determine the cycle</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Types of cycle definitions</b>
        </p>
        <p>There are two types of cycle definitions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Monthly </b>cycle definitions can contain anywhere from a single month to 
 12 months. The month specified in a monthly cycle definition indicates 
 the end of the period. Any applicable records management actions that 
 depend on the cycle become eligible at the start of the following period. 
 <p class="ex"><b>Example: </b>A monthly cycle definition with one period set to December 
 creates a yearly cycle where records would become eligible for cutoff 
 and vital records would be due for review on January 1. Another monthly cycle definition with six periods (i.e., February, April, June, August, October, December) creates a bimonthly cycle where records would become eligible for cutoff on the first day of the month following the end of the period (e.g., March 1 for the February period).</p></li>
            <li><b>Daily </b>cycle definitions can contain anything from a single day to seven days. 
 Any applicable records management actions that depend on the cycle become 
 eligible at the start of the specified day. <p class="ex"><b>Example: </b>A daily cycle 
 definition that has one period set to Wednesday creates a weekly cycle 
 where records would become eligible for cutoff on Wednesday.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Monthly cycle definitions and daily cycle definitions behave differently. 
 A monthly cycle period definition indicates the end of the period, 
 with records management actions becoming eligible on the first day of 
 the next month. A daily cycle period definition indicates the 
 day of the week on which records management actions become eligible.</p>
