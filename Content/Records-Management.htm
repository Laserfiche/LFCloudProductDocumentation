        <h1>Records Management</h1>
        <p>Records management features in Laserfiche allow you to process records and record folders according to a life cycle, through creation, retrieval, storage, and disposition. Records managers can define file plans and configure retention rules specific to their organization, and then view properties and status information for individual records and record folders in the new Records tab of the Metadata Pane. You can access this information in the Folder Browser or when viewing a record in the Document Viewer. The life-cycle timeline displays the record's history and disposition eligibility, and eligible actions such as cutoff, transfer, accession, and destruction can be performed directly on the timeline. 
Records managers can quickly generate reports of records currently eligible for cutoff, disposition, and vital record review through the Records Management quick access list. Disposition actions can then be performed directly from the report.</p>
