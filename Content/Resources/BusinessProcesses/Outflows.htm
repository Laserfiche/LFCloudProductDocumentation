        <p>Outflow settings let you specify which path within a <a href="Business-Processes.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">business process</a> a <a href="Key-Concepts-in-Forms.htm#Process" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">process flow</a> should take. For example, suppose a process contains a <a href="User-Tasks.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">user task</a> in which a manager approves or denies a form. The outflow settings let you designate one course of action for an approved form and another course for a denied form.</p>
        <p>Once a gateway is connected to other objects in the process, its outflow settings will appear in its settings window, as follows.</p>

        <p><b>To configure an outflow path</b>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Type the name of the path in <b>Path Name</b>. This name appears on the line that connects the object to the following object.</li>
            <li><b>Optional</b>:&#160;Select the <b>This is the default outflow path option</b> to set the outflow path as the default path.</li>
            <li>If you do not select the option in step 2, select the <b>Conditional Expression</b> text box and <a href="Using-Conditional-Expressions.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">specify the conditions</a> that must be met for the outflow path to be taken.</li>
            <li>When the conditions for more than one outflow path are met, the first set of conditions is used. When you are configuring the outflow paths of a <a href="Gateways.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">gateway</a>, you can drag and drop the different outflow paths to put them in the correct order. To drag and drop a path, use the <b>Move</b> icon in the top right corner of the outflow path description.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> When an outflow is the only outflow configured for an inclusive or exclusive gateway and a process instance doesn't satisfy the outflow's condition, the process instance will terminate rather than take the outflow path.</p>
