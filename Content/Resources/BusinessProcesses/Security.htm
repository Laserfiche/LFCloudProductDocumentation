        <h1>Security Roles for Business Processes</h1>
        <p>Security roles determine users' access and rights to business processes and forms. To prevent users from making unauthorized changes, you should assign your users security roles that fit their organizational responsibilities.</p>
        <p>The security role assigned to a user determines their permissions with respect to individual forms, business processes (including the forms in them), and teams.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Security for Business Processes</h2>
        <p>To learn the permissions that each role has with respect to <a href="Business-Processes.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">business processes</a>, read about <a href="../Managing-Account-Administration.htm#Choose" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">security roles in Process Automation</a>. The rights that each role has for business processes are exactly the same as the rights that each role has for other processes (e.g. workflows) in Process Automation.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Security for Independent Forms</h2>
        <p>In addition to the standard Process Automation security roles, there is an additional <a href="#Form" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Form Developer</a> role, which allows users to create <a href="../Surveys/Form-Surveys.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">surveys</a> for independent use outside of business processes.</p>
        <p>For individual forms in a process, the security roles in Process Automation correspond to the following privileges.</p>
        <h3>Process Administrator</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Full administrative access to business processes and teams</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Process Asset Administrator</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Can </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Process Developer</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Full administrative access to business processes and teams</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Process Manager</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Read-only access to business processes and surveys. Process managers can run a business process, start a survey, or update survey details like name and description, but cannot publish surveys or business processes.</li>
            <li>Limited access to teams. Process managers can view, modify, and create teams, but cannot delete or export teams except for teams they have created themselves.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><a name="Form"></a>Form Developer</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Can create surveys.</li>
            <li>Has full administrative rights over all forms</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Team Administration</h2>
        <p>When a user has full administrative access to a <a href="Getting-Started-with-Team-Management.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">team</a>, that means they can create, modify, view, export, and delete teams. They will also see all teams in the drop-down menu of teams under <b>Team Tasks</b>, and can view tasks from all teams in the <b><a href="Managing-Tasks-in-the-Inbox.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more."><b>Tasks</b> tab</a></b>.</p>
