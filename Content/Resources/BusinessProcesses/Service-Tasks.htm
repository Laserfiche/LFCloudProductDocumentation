        <h1>Service Tasks</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Forms" />Service tasks represent actions by a service or program in a business process. One example of a service task is sending an email notification to users involved in the process.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Why use a service task?</h2>
        <p>Use a service task to send an email notification, save a form to the repository, start a workflow, or run a rule within a process. If a user must take action as part of the task, use a <a href="User-Tasks.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">user task</a> instead.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Email"></a>Email Service Tasks</h2>
        <p>Email service tasks automatically send an email to one or more users at a specified point in the business process. These service tasks are useful if a user does not have to take action in a process but should still be kept informed of its progress.</p>
        <p>Email service tasks are represented by the following symbol: <img src="Resources/Images/email-service-task-icon.PNG" style="width: 23px;height: 18px;" /></p>

        <p>Workflow service tasks start a workflow at a specific time in a business process. In the Workflow Service Task properties window, select the name of the workflow that should begin and the variables you want to send as inputs when the process reaches the service task. This service task lets you retrieve values from the completed workflow and assign those values to process variables.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>When passing workflow outputs to checkboxes, dropdowns, and radio buttons, if the option already exists in the variable, it will show as selected on the next form. If the option does not already exist, the behavior varies.
            	<ul><li>For checkboxes and dropdowns, an output value that does not exist will be appended to the options list and selected on the next form. </li><li>For radio buttons, an output value that does not exist will not lead to any selection or change in the list.</li></ul></li>
            <li> If a workflow output is mapped to a field inside a table or collection, all existing values for that field will be replaced. To change specific values in a table/collection:
            <ol><li>Pass the table variable to the workflow as a multi-value input parameter.</li><li>Make the desired changes to the row elements in the workflow.</li><li>Pass the token back via multi-value output parameter into the same field.</li></ol></li>
            <li>Any invalid value passed back will erase any existing value in the variable.</li>
            <li>Any blank value passed back will erase existing values</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Supported data types for workflow interactions:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Input values: Single line, Multi-line, Radio button, Checkbox (as a whole and all individual options), Dropdown, Address (as a whole and all individual fields), Number, Email, Date (with or without time), Time, Currency, Geolocation (as a whole and each individual sub-field), and any supported fields in tables and collections.</li>
            <li>Not supported: File upload, Rich text, Signature, and Custom HTML.</li>
            <li>Output values: Single line, Multi-line, Radio button, Checkbox (as a whole and all individual options), Dropdown, Address (individual fields), Number, Email, Date (with or without time), Time, Currency, Geolocation (individual sub-fields only), and any supported fields in tables and collections.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ex"><b>Example:</b> When a sales representative submits an initial inquiry form, a workflow runs that calculates a time estimate for the project, creates custom client documents in the repository, and creates a WebLink URL to the client documents. After the workflow finishes, it passes the URL back to business processes. Business processes then sends a new form to the sales representative with a link to the information packet.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If the task fails to create the document in the repository. </li>
            <li>If the task is unable to upload attachments to the repository.</li>
            <li>If any uncaught exception errors occur when the PDF is being generated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first two issues most commonly occur either when the built in ProcessAutomation user has not been granted access to the desired repository locations, or when fields are populated with incompatible data types or are to long for the destination fields.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b>&#160;When the Save to Repository task does fail, any documents or files created before the point of failure will be left behind. If you retry the step in the process without checking, duplicate documents can be created. For example, if saving a form with attachments fails after the PDF is generated and saved, but while attempting to upload the attachments, the PDF document will not be deleted.</p>
