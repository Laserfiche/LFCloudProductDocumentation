        <h1>Start Events</h1>
        <p>Start events are <a href="Events.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">events</a> used to start a <a href="Business-Processes.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">business process</a>. Most processes will be started by a <a href="#Message" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">message start event</a>, which represents a form submission. You can also start events on a fixed schedule by using <a href="#Timer" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">timer start events</a>, or start them manually using a <a href="#Generic" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">generic start event</a>.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Generic"></a>Generic Start Event</h2>
        <p>This generic start event lets a user start the process manually, as opposed to starting it with a form submission. This lets you push content and forms to other users when you want to.</p>
        <p>Generic start events are represented by the following symbol: <img src="Resources/Images/generic-start-event-icon.PNG" /></p>
        <p class="ex"><b>Tip:</b> If you are building a process that begins with a form submission, use a <b>message start event</b>. If you are building a form that is manually started and does not begin with a form submission, use a <b>start event</b>.</p>
        <h3>Configuring Generic Start Events</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Double-click the event on the canvas to open its properties window.</li>
            <li>Type a name for the event in <b>Name</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Message"></a>Message Start Event</h2>
        <p>Message start events start a process when a form is submitted. This is the most commonly used start event  and is useful for capturing information that you can use in a business process. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.For Next Version">You can also <a href="../../Forms-On-Premises/Completing-a-Message-Start-Event-using-HTTP-POST.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">use an HTTP POST request</a> to complete a starting form.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p>Message start events are represented by the following symbol: <img src="Resources/Images/message-start-event-icon.PNG" /></p>
        <p class="ex"><b>Example:</b> You can design a process with a message start event that represents an employee's submission of a travel request form. After the form is submitted, the process routes the form to the employeeâ€™s manager for review. The diagram below shows how these two stages of the process look like in the process diagram.</p>
