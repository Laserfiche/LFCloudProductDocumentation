        <h1>Smart Invoice Profiles</h1>
        <p>A <MadCap:toggler targets="smart invoice">smart invoice profile</MadCap:toggler>  uses machine learning to automatically capture the invoice date, invoice number, purchase order number, and total amount due, in typed or handwritten form, and can also  determine the vendor of the invoice by comparing invoice data to a vendor <a href="../Entities/lookup-tables.htm">lookup table</a>. Optionally, the profile can also capture the shipping address, invoice subtotal, tax amount, and tax ID. Similar to other capture profiles, the <a href="../Workflow/Activities/Run-Capture-Profile.htm">Run Capture Profile</a> Workflow activity runs this smart invoice profile and outputs tokens for the captured data to be used later in the workflow. </p>

        <p><b>To create a smart invoice profile</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the Capture Profiles page, click <b>Smart Invoice Profiles</b> in the left pane. You can also click the <b>New</b> button or click the drop-down and select <b>Smart Invoice Profile</b>.</li>
            <li>Click <b>New</b> or click the drop-down next to <b>New</b> and select <b>Smart Invoice Profile</b>. </li>
            <li>Give the profile a name and description, then click <b>Create</b>.</li>
            <li>The invoice date, invoice number, PO number, and total amount will be automatically captured. Select one or more checkboxes next to the additional fields you want captured: shipping address, subtotal, tax amount, or tax ID.</li>
            <li>If you want to identify the invoice vendor and retrieve additional vendor information from the invoice, select <b>Capture vendor information</b>, then select the table containing the vendor information.</li>
            <li>The <b>Include a token with the 10 best matches</b> option will return multi-value tokens for the ten vendors with the closest match, not just the first vendor match. These tokens are: <i>Top10VendorName, Top10VendorId</i>, and <i>Top10VendorConfidence</i>. This allows an invoice reviewer to quickly choose alternate vendor information if there are close matches. </li>
            <li>When finished, save <img src="../../Images/Capture-Profiles/SaveButton.PNG" />, <a href="#Test">test</a>, <img src="../../Images/Capture-Profiles/Test.png" /> and publish <img src="../../Images/Capture-Profiles/PublishButton.PNG" /> the profile.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Vendor"></a>Vendor Identification</h2>
        <p>By enabling vendor identification, you can dynamically retrieve vendor information from invoices, as part of Smart Invoice Capture. Enabling vendor identification will make the following tokens available:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <col />
            <col />
            <thead>

                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>TopVendorName</td>
                    <td>The name of the vendor as defined in the lookup table column: vendor_name</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>TopVendorID</td>
                    <td>The vendor ID as defined in the lookup table column: vendor_id</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>TopVendorConfidence</td>
                    <td>The confidence that the vendor was identified correctly, as a percentage. 100% being completely confident. </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Top10VendorName (Optional)</td>
                    <td>The names of the top 10 vendors with the closest match, not just the first match</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Top10VendorID (Optional)</td>
                    <td>The IDs of the top 10 vendors with the closest match, not just the first match</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Top10VendorConfidence (Optional)</td>
                    <td>The confidence levels of the top 10 vendors with the closest match, not just the first match</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>To use vendor identification, you'll need to first create a vendor table with the required columns listed below. Vendor tables are created as <a href="../Entities/lookup-tables.htm">lookup tables</a> under Data Management in Process Automation. Lookup tables can be created by importing Excel or CSV files, which is helpful if you have a list of approved vendors in this format or can export data in this format from a financial application.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Images/vendorTable.png" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: ;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: ;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: ;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: ;width: 632px;height: 355px;" alt="Sample vendor lookup table" title="Ensure your vendor lookup table has the required columns" />
        </p>
        <p>You will need to change the column names in the lookup table to match the column labels expected by Capture Profiles. You can include columns in addition to the ones required by Laserfiche to augment your lookup table. </p>
        <p class="ex"><b>Example:</b> In addition to the required columns, you may want to add a Default GL&#160;Code column to reduce the need for users to manually perform invoice coding. You could also add a Payment Terms column to notate payment schedules or discounts.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> When importing your vendor table, we recommend editing the column types so they are all set to "Text."</p>
        <h3><a name="Required"></a><b>Required Column Names</b>
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>vendor_id</li>

            <li>state</li>
            <li>street</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Vendor Identification is currently only supported for vendors with U.S. addresses.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p><b>Note:</b> If you need to update your vendor list at any point, you can do so in a variety of ways. <ul><li>Manually export the <a href="../Entities/lookup-tables.htm">lookup table</a>, make your edits, and then import it again.</li><li>Automatically import updated lookup tables using the <a href="../Workflow/Activities/Replace-Lookup-Table-Data.htm">Replace Lookup Table Data</a> activity. </li><li>Automatically add vendors, row by row, using the Capture Profile designer.</li></ul></p>
        </div>
        <p>
        </p>
        <div class="note"><b>Note:</b> When the Workflow activity runs the smart invoice profile, eight tokens will be captured: <i>TotalAmount, TotalAmountConfidence, InvoiceNumber, InvoiceNumberConfidence, InvoiceDate, InvoiceDateConfidence, PONumber,</i> and <i>PONumberConfidence</i>. Additionally, if vendor identification is enabled, three vendor identification tokens will be captured: <i>TopVendorName, TopVendorID</i>, and <i>TopVendorConfidence</i>. Additionally, if you selected to <b>Include a token with the 10 best matches</b>, the <i>Top10VendorName</i>, <i>Top10VendorID</i>, and <i>Top10VendorConfidence</i> tokens will also be captured. The confidence tokens reflect how confident the machine learning algorithm was in capturing the correct data. Process designers can use these confidence tokens to create conditions to set their own thresholds and route data for additional manual validation. </div>
