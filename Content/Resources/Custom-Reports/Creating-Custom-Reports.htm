        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: Forms variables containing <a href="../../Forms-Current/Form-Fields/Collection.htm" title="Collections in Forms" alt="Collections in Forms">collections</a> or <a href="../../Forms-Current/Form-Fields/Table.htm" title="Tables in Forms" alt="Tables in Forms">tables</a> are not currently supported. To report on processes that contain collections or tables, use the <a href="../../Forms-Current/Monitoring-Process-Instances-and-Tasks.htm" title="Monitoring Process Instances and Tasks" alt="Monitoring Process Instances and Tasks">Business Process monitor page</a> to download all instances and use a spreadsheet application for reporting. Alternatively, you could create a forms report to view the submission data using the <a href="../../Forms-Current/Analytics/Viewing-Form-Submission-Data.htm" title="Viewing Form Submission Data" alt="Viewing Form Submission Data">Business Process report page</a>.</p>
        <p><b>Examples</b>
        </p>
