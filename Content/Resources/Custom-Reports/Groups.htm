        <h1>Custom Report Groups</h1>
        <p>The group field determines how to group instances in the report. You can leave this blank to have each instance be on its own, or put in a field to group based on that field. Some field types have different ways to scope the grouping as defined below.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: If a group field is not added, the report will group by instance ID.</p>
        <p>To add a group field, drag any variable from the Fields pane on the left into the group field in the center pane or click the variable and choose <b>Move to Group</b> from the drop-down menu. </p>
        <p>If variables have been placed in the <a href="Values.htm" title="Learn more about values." alt="Learn more about values.">Values</a> field, they will immediately by grouped by the variable placed in the group field.</p>
        <p><b>Example</b>
        </p>
        <p>The following custom report uses the Department variable to group find the count of name values within each department.</p>
