            <MadCap:concept term="RPA" />Troubleshooting Workers</h1>
        <p>You can troubleshoot and view the status of your <a href="Worker-Agents.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">workers</a> by navigating to the worker  in the <b>Workers</b> tab of a <a href="Remote-Agents.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">remote agent</a>. These logs can help you determine why a worker stopped, when you need to reconfigure a worker, or when a worker is not performing as expected.
</p>
        <p>The logs contain the following sections:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Worker Status</b>: This section states the last time the worker made a successful call to Process Automation.</li>
            <li><b>Status</b>: This section says whether the worker is enabled or disabled.</li>
            <li><b>Events</b>: This section provides a detailed log of when major events occur for the selected worker (e.g., when there is a connection error, when a resource is deleted, when authorization fails, etc.).</li>
            <li><b>History</b>: This section describes the progress of the worker's work items. For example, if the work item involves looking up a data source, it can indicate whether the data query successfully ran.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Viewing the Version of a Remote Agent Worker</h2>
        <ol>
