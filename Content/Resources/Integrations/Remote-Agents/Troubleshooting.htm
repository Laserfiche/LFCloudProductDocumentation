            <MadCap:concept term="RPA" />Troubleshooting Workers</h1>
        <p>You can troubleshoot and view the status of your <a href="Worker-Agents.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">workers</a> by navigating to the worker  in the <b>Workers</b> tab of a <a href="Remote-Agents.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">remote agent</a>. These logs can help you determine why a worker stopped, when you need to reconfigure a worker, or when a worker is not performing as expected.
</p>
        <p>The logs contain the following sections:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Worker Status</b>: This section states the last time the worker made a successful call to Process Automation.</li>
            <li><b>Status</b>: This section says whether the worker is enabled or disabled.</li>
            <li><b>Events</b>: This section provides a detailed log of when major events occur for the selected worker (e.g., when there is a connection error, when a resource is deleted, when authorization fails, etc.).</li>
            <li><b>History</b>: This section describes the progress of the worker's work items. For example, if the work item involves looking up a data source, it can indicate whether the data query successfully ran.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Viewing the Version of a Remote Agent Worker</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>From the configuration page for your remote agent, click the Workers tab. For each registered worker take note of the displayed version number.</li>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Ensure your remote agent workers are version 11.4.2208.01001 or higher.</p>
        </ul>
        <h2>Viewing the Event Log for a Remote Agent Worker</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>From the configuration page for your remote agent, click the Workers tab. For a specific registered worker, expand the <b>Events</b> section, to view a log of when major events occur for the selected worker.</li>
            <li>From the text log for the running service, located at one of the following folders depending on your choice during installation:<ul><li><p>C:\Users\{UserName}\AppData\Roaming\Laserfiche\BPMServer\Laserfiche.ProcessAutomation.LocalAgent</p><p><b>or</b></p></li><li><p>C:\ProgramData\Laserfiche\BPMServer\Laserfiche.ProcessAutomation.LocalAgent</p></li></ul></li>
