            <p>If the student was previously enrolled in or is currently enrolled in the section, this action will act as an update action. It will ensure the registration is set to "registered" and will try to update the other fields in the case that they are different than what is currently in the existing registration. (If the previous registration is "not registered", after executing the register section action, the credit field will not be updated due to Ellucian update api behavior and will be reverted back to old value.)</p>
            <p>The student must be enrolled in the academic period and be eligible to enroll in the course.</p>
