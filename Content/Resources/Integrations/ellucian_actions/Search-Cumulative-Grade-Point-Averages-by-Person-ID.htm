            <p><b>Notes:</b> </p>
		<p>Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) is based on academic level. There is no duplicate cumulative GPA for the same combination of academic level and academic source. If a student was pursuing multiple programs of the same academic level, the cumulative GPA for that academic level would include both programs.</p>
		<p>For a given academic level, the cumulative GPA with academic source "overall" is calculated based on the cumulative GPA with academic source "institution" and "transfer".</p>
		<p>For academic source of cumulative GPA with any academic level, "overall" is always published. However, "institution" or "transfer" are not guaranteed.</p>
		<p>Example for "attempted credit", "earned credits", and "quality points": For each grade included in the calculation of grade point averages the ERP identifies if that grade will be included in student attempted credits and earned credits. For example, a passing grade of ‘B’ in a 3-credit section will most likely be included in the total attempted and earned credits for the student. However, a failing grade of ‘F’ in the same 3-credit section would count in overall attempted credits but not in earned credits. Each grade is also assigned a quality point value that is used to calculate the g.p.a. On a common 4.0 scale an A grade would have a value of 4 quality points, a B grade 3 quality point, etc. Example, a student who earns an ‘A’ grade in a 3-credit section would have attempted credits = 3, earned credits = 3, quality points = 12.00 (quality points x attempted credits), and a gpa of 4.00 (quality points/attempted credits).</p>
