        <p>The output fields are the same as the <a href="Search-Student-by-Banner-ID.htm">Search Student by Banner ID</a> action.</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
		<p>The "Email/Email Address" type that is mapped in the connection will be used for the search. So "Email/Email Address" is mapped to "School(school) Email Address" then only Students with the inputted "School" email will return in the results. A person with the inputted Email but of a different type (e.g. "Family (family) Email Address") will not be included in the results.</p>
		<p>The results will be sorted alphabetically by the student's last name, followed by the student's first name.</p>
