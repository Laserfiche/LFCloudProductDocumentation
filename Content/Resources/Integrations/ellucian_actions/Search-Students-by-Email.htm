        <p>A field marked with an asterisk "*" indicates the field is a required input for this action.</p>
        <p>This action can be used for searching all of the personal information for a student and returns one or no results.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Category:</b> Student</li>
            <li><b>Supported in:</b> Workflow and Lookup</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Input Fields</h2>
        <table id="InputFields" class="tablesorter">
            <col style="width: 25%;" />
            <col />
            <thead>

                    <td>
                        <p>Is one of the emails for the searched student.</p>
                        <p>User must input Email exactly as is on Ellucian.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
             </tbody>
        </table>
        <h2>Output Fields</h2>
        <p>Returns a single result set.</p>
        <p>The output fields are the same as the <a href="Search-Student-by-Banner-ID.htm">Search Student by Banner ID</a> action.</p>
	<div class="note">
		<p><b>Notes:</b></p>
		<p>The "Email/Email Address" type that is mapped in the connection will be used for the search. So "Email/Email Address" is mapped to "School(school) Email Address" then only Students with the inputted "School" email will return in the results. A person with the inputted Email but of a different type (e.g. "Family (family) Email Address") will not be included in the results.</p>
		<p>The results will be sorted alphabetically by the student's last name, followed by the student's first name.</p>
