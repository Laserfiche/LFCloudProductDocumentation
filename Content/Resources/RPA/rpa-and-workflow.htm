        <h1>How Do Laserfiche Bots Fit into Laserfiche Process Automation and Workflow?</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="RPA" />Robotic Process Automation fits natively into the larger Laserfiche Cloud Process Automation platform, and the bot designer is available from the Laserfiche Cloud Process Automation homepage. </p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Run Bots via Remote Agents</p>
        <p>Laserfiche bots make use of <a href="../Integrations/Remote-Agents/Remote-Agents.htm">remote agents</a>. Remote agents provide a secure connection that allows bots to run remotely on other machines and then send results back to process automation. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Invoke Bots from Workflow</p>
        <p>Bots are accessible from within workflows through the <b><a href="../Workflow/Activities/Invoke-Bot.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more."><b>Invoke Bot</b></a></b> activity. You can use workflow to pass in tokens for a bot to use (as <a href="Editing-a-Bot.htm#Configur" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">input parameters</a>) while performing its recorded tasks. Additionally, bots can produce output parameters that can be passed back to workflow and used in other activities in the workflow. </p>
