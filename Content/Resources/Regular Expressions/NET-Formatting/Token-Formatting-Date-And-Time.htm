            <MadCap:concept term="Connector;Forms;Quick Fields" />Token Formatting in Workflow and Quick Fields: Date and Time</h1>
        <p>You can <a href="Token-Formatting.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">format</a>  tokens to automatically convert dates and times entered into them into  specified formats. A standard format string is a single letter that  represents a format that your data will automatically be converted to. A  custom format string is a group of symbols that indicate the exact  format for the information. Standard format strings are just shortcuts  for frequently used formats that could also be achieved with custom  format strings. You can type these specifiers directly in the tokens or  use the Token Editor to insert the specifier and test the formatted token.</p>
        <p class="note">
            <MadCap:concept term="Laserfiche" /><b>Note:</b> A Laserfiche field that is  specifically a date field will automatically format a date inserted into  it to match the computer's regional settings without additional  formatting.  You might want to add date formatting to a token if you are  using it in a character field or in another function such as a document  name or folder path.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> A single-character date/time format  string will be interpreted as a standard date/time format string.  Multiple-character date/time format strings will be interpreted as  custom strings. To use a single-character custom string, include a %  sign before the character or a space before or after it.</p>
        <h2>Standard Date and Time Format Strings</h2>
        <p>Standard date and format strings can be inserted into tokens to format the values to match patterns determined by the  regional settings of the computer. View  the regional settings in the control panel of the computer to determine how these strings will format your tokens.</p>
