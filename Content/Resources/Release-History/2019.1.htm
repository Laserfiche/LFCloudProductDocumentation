        <h1>2019.1</h1>
        <p>The 2019.1 update for Laserfiche Cloud contains the following new Process Automation features.</p>
        <h2>Capture Profiles</h2>
        <p><a href="../Capture-Profiles/Capture-Profiles.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Capture profiles</a> extract data from documents that can be used in a business process. Using the Capture Profile Designer, you can add samples of documents you want to scan, and draw boxes around the information you want to capture. Once configured, you can test the configuration with other sample documents, then publish the profile. The <a href="../Workflow/Activities/Run-Capture-Profile.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Run Capture Profile activity</a> extracts text using a specified capture profile, then outputs tokens for the captured data that you can use later in the workflow.</p>
        <h2>External Data Sources</h2>
        <p>You can now configure <a href="../../Integrations/Remote-Agents/Remote-Agents.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">remote agents</a> to obtain data external to Laserfiche, such as Microsoft SQL and PostGreSQL databases on your organization's computers. Workers installed on your database computers can process data queries from Process Automation. Use the <a href="../Rules/Data-Queries/Getting-Started-with-Data-Queries.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Data Query rule type</a> to initiate data queries and process the results into suitable formats. This method of accessing databases on your organization's computers doesn't require you to create entities.</p>
        <h2>External Connection Profiles</h2>
        <p>Laserfiche now supports native integration options with Salesforce and Redtail. You can create an external connection profile and then use the new <a href="../../Integrations/run-crm-action.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Run CRM Action activity</a> in a workflow to push and pull information from Salesforce and Redtail, all without requiring code.</p>
        <h2>Set Records Management Properties Activity</h2>
        <p>You can automate records management actions by setting properties on individual records or records folders with the <a href="../Workflow/Activities/Set-Records-Management-Properties.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Set Records Management Properties activity</a>. The activity includes various common records management actions, such as cutting off a record and setting a filing date. In addition, you can apply properties to multiple documents at once, without using a <a href="../Workflow/Activities/For-Each-Entry.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">For Each Entry activity</a>.</p>
