        <h1>2019.2</h1>
        <p>The 2019.2 update for Laserfiche Cloud contains the following new Process Automation features.</p>
        <h2>Laserfiche Home Screen</h2>
        <p>The <a href="../../../../../Content/Home-Hub-Page.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Laserfiche home screen</a> provides a central access point to your tasks, documents, and reports. From the home screen, you can view a dashboard displaying key metrics. The home screen also allows you to directly access other Laserfiche Cloud services such as managing your business process tasks, submitting forms, and viewing reports on business processes and your repository.</p>
        <h2>Business Processes</h2>
        <p><a href="../../Forms-Current/Business-Processes.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Business Processes</a> in Process Automation brings the design and management functionality of Laserfiche Forms into Process Automation and adds new reporting options. You can view detailed reports and graphics on your business processes, including information like task completion times, potential bottlenecks, and field values from form submissions. </p>
        <p>When configuring lookup rules in a form, you can now use <a href="../Rules/Rules.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Process Automation Rules</a>, integrating information stored in decision tables, formulas, or entities into business processes.</p>
        <h2>Surveys</h2>
        <p><a href="../Surveys/Form-Surveys.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Surveys</a> in Process Automation are a method for collecting data using forms, without having to configure a full-fledged business process. You can view reports on data collected from the surveys, similar to viewing reports on business processes.</p>
        <h2>Query Data Sources</h2>
        <p>You can now query a wider variety of data sources when configuring a data query rule. Where you could previously query only Microsoft SQL Server and PostGreSQL databases, you can now also query Oracle and MySQL databases. You can also query CSV files that are hosted on an external server.</p>
        <h2>Entity Queries</h2>
        <p>You can now query entities and external data sources using the same user interface. Entity models are treated like tables in a database in the new query editor, which works for both entity queries and external data queries.</p>
        <h2>Custom Fields in Salesforce</h2>
        <p>The Salesforce integration now lets you interact with custom fields that you've created in Salesforce. You can configure access to these custom fields in the connection profile associated with your Salesforce connection. Then, you can use Workflow to create, updated, or delete these fields.</p>
        <h2>Anchor Text Pattern Matching in Capture Profiles</h2>
        <p>You can now apply pattern matching to anchors to account for variations in a zoneâ€™s anchor text and help locate the data you want to capture. For example, business licenses may label the name of the business Name, Business Name, Granted To, Company, etc. By using a pattern to find all the different variants of business name labels, you will be able to capture the business name, regardless of which business name label it follows. Additionally, user interface enhancements have been applied to test results when testing a capture profile, including the ability to see a preview of the sample and test documents and their OCRed text.</p>
