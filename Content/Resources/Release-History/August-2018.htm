        <h1>August 2018</h1>
        <p>The August 2018 update for Laserfiche Cloud introduces process automation functionality that features workflow capabilities focused on document routing and repository organization. This article highlights the process automation tools new to Laserfiche Cloud.</p>
        <p><b>Workflow</b>
        </p>
        <p>Build processes to extract data, route documents, and more. Create workflows to automate your business processes using pre-built activities in a drag-and-drop designer. Take advantage of reporting capabilities to interpret the performance of processes.</p>
        <p><b>Starting Events</b>
        </p>
        <p>Starting events allow you to start your processes based on a set of conditions. Defined separately from individual processes, starting events can be attached to as many processes as you like.</p>
        <p><b>Rules</b>
        </p>
        <p>Rules allow you to separate your business logic from your processes. Place your policies and decision logic in standalone rules that can reused across multiple workflows. Define your policies once and apply them to as many processes as you like. When you want to update the business logic, there is no need to redesign the individual processes where the logic is used. And with rule versioning, you can keep track of your changes.</p>
        <p><b>Entities</b>
        </p>
        <p>Entities provide a mechanism for storing external data that may be required by your business processes. Use entities to define data models and then import your data to Laserfiche Cloud to perform lookups from your processes, without exposing your line-of-business applications to the outside world. Data can be synchronized from your existing systems on a schedule using a SDK.</p>
        <p><b>Settings</b>
        </p>
        <p>Process automation also introduces the concept of work schedules. Now, you can specify your business hours, holidays, and time zone. When calculating deadlines or reviewing data, your processes can assign work when users are present.</p>
        <p><b>Notifications</b>
        </p>
        <p>Process automation includes in-app notifications located in the navigation bar. Without leaving the site, you can stay up-to-date on when a process starts, completes, and more. You can also set up digests that are regularly sent to your email.</p>
