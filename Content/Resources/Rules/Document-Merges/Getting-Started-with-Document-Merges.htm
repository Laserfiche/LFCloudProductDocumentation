        <h1>Getting Started with Document Merges</h1>
        <p>Document Merges let you define where external data should appear in a Word or PDF document. This allows you to create multiple customized documents that use your original document as a template. With the document merge rule, you can upload a Word document that has merge fields or a PDF document with fillable fields and, in a workflow, replace those fields with token values. The rule also lets you preview test values before you include the document in a workflow.</p>
        <p class="ex"><b>Example</b>: You want to create an invoice template that you can use to record any customer's billing address, invoice number, and purchase details. You can include merge fields for each of these pieces of data so that when the document is included in a running workflow, token values can dynamically replace the merge fields with the relevant customer information.</p>
