        <h2>Importing Old Versions of Entity Queries</h2>
        <p>Entity queries that were exported prior to the April 2019 release of Laserfiche Cloud have a different format from entity queries exported after that release. The following happens when you import an entity query in the old format to Laserfiche Cloud:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Laserfiche will attempt to match the old rule format to the new one as far as possible. Parts of your query may be unfilled or look different in some cases. You will be asked to verify the updated query as displayed in the rule editor.</li>
            <li>When you publish the rule in its new format for the first time, you will overwrite the old query data. You will be warned of this when you first attempt to publish the new rule.</li>
            <li>Publishing the new rule counts as a major version change because of the change in format.</li>
        </ul>
