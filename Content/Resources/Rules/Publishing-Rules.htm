        <h1>Publishing Rules</h1>
        <p>The publishing feature in Rules allows you to make a rule ready to run in processes. </p>
        <p>It is a useful way to ensure that both the rule creator and process designer are using a rule that will not break the processes to which the rule is added. Publishing indicates to the process designer that the rule is not going to break any processes.</p>
        <p>After publishing more than one rule, you want to ensure that the process designer knows the correct version to use in workflows and business processes. You can ensure they are using the correct version by referencing the version number. The version number updates each time a rule is published. <a href="Versioning-for-Rules.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Learn more about versioning.</a></p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Testing Rules</p>
        <p>Before you send a rule over to the process designer, it is a good idea to test that the rule works as you expect. Each rule editor has a test feature in the toolbar that allows you to enter values for each input to the rule. After you run the test, an output is produced, which you can compare to your expected result.</p>
