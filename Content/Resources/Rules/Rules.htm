        <h1>Rules</h1>
        <p>Rules are instructions for how to perform actions. They are defined independently of the <a href="../Get-Started.htm" title="Click here to learn more about Process Automation." alt="Click here to learn more about Process Automation.">processes</a> in which they are used, so you can reuse the same rule across many processes. This also helps ensure that your logic is applied consistently across your processes.</p>
        <p><b>Overview of Rules</b>

        <p>Each type of rule has its own rule editor that provides the tools you need to configure the type of operation for that rule type. You can read more about each type of rule as follows:</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Each rule editor includes options to validate, test, publish, and version your rules. Validating and testing help ensure that the rules work as you expect, before you apply the rules across your processes. Publishing and versioning help ensure that the rules you use in your processes are the correct version.</p>
