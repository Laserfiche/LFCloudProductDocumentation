        <h1>Viewing Usage Statistics</h1>
        <p>On the right in Rules, you can view the usage statistics for a selected rule. With usage statistics, you can glance at an overview of the performance for a selected rule, after the rule runs in a process. That means, test-runs do not impact the usage statistics for a rule.</p>
        <p>Each rule’s usage statistics are displayed on a card. The card displays the total number of instances started, completed, and terminated for all the instances within the timeframe. The card reports on all the instances in a specified timeframe, as well as specific or all of the associated resources. You can report on additional timeframes by adding cards.</p>
        <p>The following example card provides an overview of the instances for the selected rule in the last seven days within the specified resource “Example Workflow”:</p>

        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include">The right pane in Rules displays a performance overview for a selected rule. Each overview is presented on a card, which reports on the instances in a specific timeframe and a specific or all associated resources. The card has the total number of instances started, completed, and terminated, as well as the average duration of all the instances within the specific timeframe and the number of warnings (unexpected events that do not terminate the instance). The number of warnings only appears when you receive a warning. The following example card provides an overview of the instances for the selected rule in the last seven days within the specified workflow resource called <i>Example Workflow</i>:</p>

        <p class="note" MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include"><b>Note</b>:&#160;The statistics in this pane only updates when a rule runs in a workflow. You can use the second drop-down to filter the workflow and then recreate a warning by manually testing the rule with the workflow inputs in the rule editor.</p>
