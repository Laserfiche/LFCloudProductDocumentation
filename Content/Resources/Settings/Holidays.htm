        <h1>Holidays</h1>
        <p>You can define the holidays excluded when the <b>Exclude weekends and holidays</b> option is selected. The holidays are pulled from the centralized list of holidays on the Holidays page. You can create a holiday from two locations: on the Holidays page and directly in the Work Schedule editor when adding a new holiday to the work schedule.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Centralized List of Holidays</h2>
        <p>The centralized list (in the image below) lets you browse and manage shared holidays. The columns in the list help you quickly scan through what is observed, as well as the previous and next holiday occurrences. Any holidays that are not observed are skipped in the work schedule. You can add any of the holidays in the centralized list to your work schedules.</p>

        <h2 class="topicheading">Importing Holidays</h2>
        <p>The import option on the Holidays page lets you add system-defined holidays, like Chinese New Year and Easter. These holidays have their dates predefined, but you have the option to change details like the duration and whether the holiday should be observed on a company level. The options in this list are the same as the ones available in Workflow 10. <a href="https://www.laserfiche.com/support/webhelp/Laserfiche/10/en-us/administration/Default.htm#../Subsystems/LFWorkflow/Content/Resources/Admin Console/Holidays Node.htm" target="_blank">Read more.</a></p>
