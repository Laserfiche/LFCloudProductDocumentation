        <h1>Work Schedules</h1>
        <p>Work schedules define the business days and time zones in Workflow. When the <b>Exclude weekends and holidays</b> option is selected, workflow refers to the work schedule to determine what counts as a weekend or <a href="Holidays.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">holiday</a>. When no work schedules are created, the date and time are defined by the business days  Monday through Friday, from 9 AM to 5 PM pacific time.</p>
        <p>You can find the <b>Exclude weekends and holidays</b> option in the following activities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="../Workflow/Activities/Deadline.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Deadline</a>
            </li>

        </ul>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Centralized List of Work Schedules
</h2>
        <p>The centralized list (in the image below) lets you browse and manage shared work schedules. When you select a schedule, you can view a brief summary in the right pane, which includes the schedule’s time zone, work hours, and selected holidays. You can use one work schedule from this list throughout process automation, by setting the schedule as the default.</p>

        </p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Setting the Default</h2>
        <p>The first work schedule you create is automatically set as the default, meaning it is used when the <b>Exclude weekends and holidays</b> option is selected. It also means that all the dates and times you configure in your workflows are with respect to the time zone in this work schedule. When you create multiple work schedules, you can decide which work schedule you want to use by setting that schedule as the default. The default schedule has a flag placed to the left of its name and is included in the <b>Work Schedule Profile</b> section in the properties pane of the workflow designer.</p>
        <p>To set the default:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a work schedule.</li>
