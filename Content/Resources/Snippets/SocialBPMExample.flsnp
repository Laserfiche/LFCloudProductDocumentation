        <p class="ex"><b>Example:</b> The people in Pleasant County can fill out a form if they want to rent a public facility for an event. There are several common questions people have about renting facilities such as, how much will it cost? How long can I rent the facility for? Am I responsible for clean up? etc. Pleasant County created a "Public Facilities" group in Laserfiche Discussions where they answered all these questions. Then they chose to display these FAQ on the "Rent a Facility" form. Because the FAQ are right next to the form and because the public can submit questions right there, the number of phone calls they've had to field about facility rentals has dramatically decreased. </p>
