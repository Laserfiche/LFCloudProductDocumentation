        <h1>Creating a Condition Event</h1>
        <p>Use the <b>Set Conditions</b> step to specify the conditions that must be satisfied for the starting event to run.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the <b>Event type</b> menu, select the type of event in the repository for the starting event to run. (More information below)</li>
            <li>In the <b>Repository</b> menu, select the repository you want to monitor for the selected event type.</li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Default.Update 2">Select the <b>Exclude process automation user</b> option to ignore triggers created by the <a href="../Entry-Access-Rights.htm" title="Click here to read more about the ProcessAutomationUser account." alt="Click here to read more about the ProcessAutomationUser account.">ProcessAutomationUser account</a>.

        <h2 MadCap:conditions="Default.Update 2">Excluding the Process Automation User</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Update 2">In some cases, a workflow or <a href="../../Resources/BusinessProcesses/Business-Processes.htm" title="Click to learn more about business processes." alt="Click to learn more about business processes.">business process</a> performs an event type that also satisfies a condition within a starting event. For example, a starting event starts a workflow when an entry is created in the repository, and the workflow associated with the starting event creates an entry in the repository. The workflow and starting event together can start a loop of workflows which will exhaust your limit, in which the creation of an entry in the repository also triggers the start of that workflow. The <b>Exclude Process Automation user</b> option prevents this from happening. When selected, the starting event does not start a workflow when the action is performed by the workflow application or a business process.</p>
