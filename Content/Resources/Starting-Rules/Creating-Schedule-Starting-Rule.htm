        <h1>Creating a Timer Event</h1>
        <p>Use the <b>Set Timer</b> step to specify a start time and recurrence schedule.<ol><li>Use the blue text and drop-down next to <b>Start On</b> to select a date, time, and time zone when the event starts. Note that the time zone you select here is your time zone. For example, if you are on the east coast and set a starting event to start at 9 AM Eastern Standard Time (EST) by selecting "Atlantic Time (Canada)", the starting event will start at 9 AM EST.</li><li>Select how often you want the event to repeat next to <b>Repeats</b>. (More information below)</li><li>Set up how often you want the workflow or bot to repeat after the schedule starts when you select <b>Rerun starting event every</b>. For example, when you set a daily schedule and rerun the starting event every 15 minutes for one hour, the starting event runs five times a day.</li><p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The <b>Rerun starting event every</b> condition doesn't cause the workflow or bot to repeat beyond the end of the day. For example, if you schedule a workflow to run every 15 minutes for one hour and set its starting time to be 11:30pm daily, the workflow will run only twice daily: at 11:45pm and 11:30pm. It will not run at 12:00am, 12:15am, etc. because those times are part of the next day. On the next day, it will start at 11:30pm again.</p><p class="w"><b>Important:</b> As a best practice, timer repetitions should be at least 15 minutes apart.</p><li>Specify when you want the event to stop running when you select <b>Stop the timer on</b>.</li></ol><p class="note"><b>Note</b>: You can create up to <MadCap:snippetText src="../Snippets/object-limit.flsnp" /> starting events. <a href="../../service/Service-Limits.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Learn more about service limits</a></p><h2>Testing a Timer Event</h2><p>Click <b>Show Tests</b> to view the dates and times when the schedule will run. The <b>Test count</b> textbox lets you specify the number of dates and times you want to see from the schedule. For example, when you type "5" in the textbox, the first five dates and times when the starting event will run will appear.</p><h2><a name="Setting"></a>Setting Up a Repeat Schedule</h2><p>You can use the following types of repeat options:</p><table id="myTable" class="tablesorter" border="0" summary="This table lists the ContactRecord tokens availabe in Laser App that can be used when configuring your integration."><caption>Repeat Options</caption><col /><col /><thead><tr><th><b>Name</b></th><th><b>Description</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="tabletext">Never</td><td class="tabletext">Start the workflow or bot once.</td></tr><tr><td class="tabletext">Daily</td><td class="tabletext">Start the workflow or bot everyday, weekday, or number of days (e.g., every 1 day repeats everyday, every 2 days repeats every other day).</td></tr><tr><td class="tabletext">Weekly</td><td class="tabletext">Start the workflow or bot on the selected days or number of weeks (e.g., every 1 week repeats every week, 2 every other week).</td></tr><tr><td class="tabletext">Monthly</td><td class="tabletext">Start the workflow or bot every month on a specific day (e.g., on the first Sunday only repeats the first Sunday of each month).</td></tr></tbody></table></p>
