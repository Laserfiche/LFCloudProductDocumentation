        <h1>Starting Events</h1>
        <p>Starting events make it easy to define how you want your processes to start. You can define your starting events once and attach them to as many processes as you like. You can also leave the starting events open-ended, so that you can define the logic before you know the specific processes you want to run.</p>
        <h2>Types</h2>
        <p>You can select from the following types of events to start a process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="Creating-Condition-Starting-Rule.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Condition starting events</a> run processes when specific events occur in a repository. This might be when a document is placed in a specific folder, for example. </li>
            <li><a href="Creating-Schedule-Starting-Rule.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Timer starting events</a> run processes based on a schedule that includes a start time and recurrence schedule. This might be on the first Friday of every month at 9 AM, for example.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Creating a Starting Event</h2>
        <p>You can create a starting event in the following ways:
