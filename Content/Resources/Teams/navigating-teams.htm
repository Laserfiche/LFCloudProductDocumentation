        <h1>Navigating Within Teams</h1>
        <p>With the introduction of project security, the Process Automation landing page has become the Global project dashboard.  From here, users can access any assigned projects through the dropdown menu attached to the selected project indicator. The dropdown will only list projects that the user has access to - either through membership in the team that owns the project or if allowed by the Project Access settings on the project itself. See <a href="determining-access-rights.htm">Determining Access Rights</a> for more information.
