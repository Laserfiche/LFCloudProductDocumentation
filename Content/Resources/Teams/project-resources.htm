        <h1>Project Resources</h1>
        <p>Project resources are the process automation elements that users and processes will have access to within a project. These currently include: <a href="../../Forms-Current/Business-Processes.htm">business processes</a>, <a href="../Rules/Decision-Tables/Getting-Started-with-Decision-Tables.htm">decision tables</a>, <a href="../Rules/Formulas/Getting-Started-with-Formulas.htm">formulas</a>, <a href="../Rules/Data-Queries/Getting-Started-with-Data-Queries.htm">queries</a>, <a href="../Surveys/Form-Surveys.htm">surveys</a>, and <a href="../Entities/lookup-tables.htm">lookup tables</a><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include">, and <a href="../Custom-Reports/Custom-Reports.htm">custom reports</a></MadCap:conditionalText>. Any resources created within the project can be used throughout that project, but are not available to other projects or to other Global resources.</p>
        <p>In addition to the project resources, you can allow a project to access resources from the Global project. You may allow all global resources for a specific type to be accessed and used or only specific resources if you do not want a project to have access to everything within Global. Resources that can be shared from Global to a project include decision tables, formulas, lookup query rules, workflows and more. </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Project-specific resources are not available to other projects.</p>

        <h3>To add resources to the project</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <!--a href="navigating-teams.htm">Navigate</a-->Navigate to the project landing page.</li>
            <li>Open the designer for the type of resource. See the links above for details on each resource type.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions for the specific resource type to create or import the resource.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Migrating Global Resources to a Project</h2>
        <p>Administrators can export a global resource and re-import the resource into a Team project.</p>
        <p>Be aware that this creates a duplicate resource. For example, business processes migrated in this manner will not have their instance data preserved and administrators will need to remap or configure other process automation resources that the business process may interact with.</p>
        <p>See <a href="../../Forms-Current/process-migration.htm" title="Click to learn more" alt="Click to tlearn more">Process Migration</a> for instructions on moving business processes between the global project and team projects.</p>
        <p>Laserfiche is actively working on integrated methods to migrate other existing resources from the global context to a project.</p>
