        <h1>Team Security Features</h1>
        <p>A Team is a collection of Users and Projects, along with the settings that govern what team members and external contributors can see and do.</p>
        <p>A Project is a collection of related process automation resources, such as business processes, rules, and lookup tables. Members of a team can design and view resources under the team's projects, in accordance with their Team Role and Laserfiche account rights.</p>
        <h2>Team Roles</h2>
        <p>The following roles can be assigned to individual users or groups to provide the necessary level of access within a process automation project.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Analyst</b> - Able to view <a href="project-resources.htm">resources</a> and submitted data that belong to the team.</li>
            <li><b>Team Developer</b> - Able to create and edit resources.</li>
            <li><b>Team Manager</b> - Able to edit the team, team projects, and set access to team resources.</li>
            <li><b>Viewer</b> - Able to view resources, but not submitted data.</li>
            <li><b>Team members with no role</b> - Used for task assignment, but unable to view or edit resources.</li>
        </ul>
