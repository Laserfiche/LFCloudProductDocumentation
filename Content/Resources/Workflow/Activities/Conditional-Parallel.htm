        <p>This activity runs all branches that have satisfied conditions.</p>
        <p class="ex"><b>Example</b>: A recruiting team receives a resume and wants to send the resume to any department that fits his credentials. To do this, the workflow designer uses a <b>Conditional Parallel</b> activity. In the first branch, the resume is emailed to the marketing department if the applicant has marketing skills using an <a href="Email.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Email</a> activity. In the second branch, the resume is emailed to the human resources department if the applicant has human resources experience, and so on. If the application has marketing and human resources experience, both departments will receive an email about the applicant.</p>
