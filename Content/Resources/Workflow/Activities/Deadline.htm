        <p>This activity defines one route for an entry before a timeout period or date (in a <b>Primary Branch</b>) and one or more for after (in a <b>Deadline Branch</b>). When the deadline is met, the <b>Primary Branch</b> is canceled and the <b>Deadline Branch</b> is processed instead. You can only add deadline branches, not primary branches.</p>

        <p class="ex"><b>Example</b>:&#160;A company receives a purchase order from a client. To respond to the purchase order promptly, the workflow designer uses a <b>Deadline</b> activity that times out in three days. In the <b>Primary Branch</b>, the designer uses an <a href="Email.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Email</a> activity to send the purchase order to the Receiving Department. After the <a href="Email.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Email</a> activity, the designer uses a <a href="Wait-for-Entry-Change.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Wait for Entry Change</a> activity to wait for the department's approval. If the department approves in three days or fewer, the customer receives an email that the purchase is being sent. However, if more than three days pass and the tasks are incomplete, the <b>Deadline Branch</b> starts and the <b>Primary Branch</b> ends. In the <b>Deadline Branch</b>, the supervisor of the Receiving Department is notified.</p>
