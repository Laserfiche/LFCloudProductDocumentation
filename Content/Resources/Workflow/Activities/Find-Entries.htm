        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: If you want to return only an individual document, use the <a href="Find-Entry.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Find Entry</a> activity instead.</p>
        <p>To set up this activity:</p>

            </li>
            <li>In the <b>Entries to Find</b> property box, specify where the activity looks for entries.</li>
            <li>Under <b>Find the entries in the</b>, select to find entries in a specified folder or find entries in the same folder as a specified entry.<p class="ex"><b>Example</b>: The Financial Statements folder, inside the Accounting folder, contains several statements. If you select to find the entries in the folder Financial Statements (specified by either its ID or path), then all of the statements in that folder will be returned.  If you select to find the entries in the same folder as the entry Financial Statements (specified by either its ID or path), then all the entries inside the Accounting folder will be returned. </p></li>
            <li>Specify how you want to find the entries:<ul><li><b>with ID</b>:&#160;Type an entry ID, or click the <b>Browse</b> button (ellipsis) <img src="../../../Images/Icon_Ellipsis_White.png" /> to browse to an entry. All documents, folders, and shortcuts stored in a Laserfiche repository are assigned a Laserfiche Entry ID number. If you choose to find entries based on an ID number, the entry with the specified ID does not need to stay at the same path for this activity to find it. Click the <b>Token</b> button (right arrow) <img src="../../../Images/Icon_Arrow_Right_White.png" />  to add a <a href="../Tokens-Regex/Tokens.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">token</a>.<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: If the ID refers to a document or shortcut (instead of a folder), the activity will return all the entries in same folder as the document or shortcut.</p></li><li><b>at</b>: Type a location path, or click the <b>Browse</b> button (ellipsis) <img src="../../../Images/Icon_Ellipsis_White.png" /> to browse to a folder. If you choose this option, the entry you specify a location for must stay at the same path for the activity to run correctly. Click the <b>Token</b> button (right arrow) <img src="../../../Images/Icon_Arrow_Right_White.png" />  to add a <a href="../Tokens-Regex/Tokens.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">token</a>.<p class="note"><b>Note</b>: If you browse to or specify a path to a document or shortcut (instead of a folder), the activity will return all the entries in same folder as the document or shortcut.</p></li></ul></li>
            <li><b>Optional</b>: Select <b>If the entry is a shortcut, use the document or folder that it references</b> to retrieve entries in the folder where the actual entry is located. If you don't select this option, the activity will return the documents in the folder where the shortcut is.</li>
            <li>In the <b>Filter Entries</b> property box, determine which entries will be returned:<ul><li><b>Documents</b>: Includes documents in the entries returned.</li><li><b>Folders</b>: Includes folders in the entries returned.</li><li><b>Document</b> Shortcuts: Includes document shortcuts in the entries returned.</li><li><b>Include the referenced documents instead of the shortcuts</b>: Returns the actual documents instead of their shortcuts.					
			<p class="ex"><b>Example</b>: If a <b>Finances</b> folder contains a shortcut to the document <b>Budget Proposal 2010</b>, selecting <b>Include the referenced documents instead of the shortcuts</b> will return the <b>Budget Proposal 2010</b> document instead of a shortcut to the document.</p></li><li><b>Folder Shortcuts</b>: Includes folder shortcuts in the entries returned.</li><li><b>Include the referenced folders instead of the shortcuts</b>: Returns the actual folders instead of their shortcuts.</li></ul></li>
