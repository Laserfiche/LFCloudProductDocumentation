        <h1>Configuring a Decision Table Rule in Workflow</h1>
        <p>This configuration of <a href="Run-Business-Rules.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">the Run Rule activity</a> allows you to reference the <a href="../../Rules/Decision-Tables/Getting-Started-with-Decision-Tables.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">decision table</a> logic to make a decision in your workflow and then use the results of the decision elsewhere in the process. When the decision table produces more than one result, you can use a <a href="For-Each-Row.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">For Each Row</a> activity to iterate over each result. The following instructions use the sample decision table from the <a href="../../Rules/Decision-Tables/hit-policy/output-order-hit-policy.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Output Order Hit Policy</a> page.</p>
        <p>To configure a decision table rule:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Drag the <b>Run Rule</b> activity from the toolbox pane and drop it in the designer pane.</li>
            <li>
                <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Snippets/Activity Name and Description Sentence.flsnp" />
            </li>
            <li>In the <b>Rule</b> property box, select <b>Decision Table Rule</b>.</li>
            <li>Select the rule and version.&#160;The version corresponds to the "Major"&#160;<a href="../../Rules/Versioning-for-Rules.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">version number</a> for the  rule.</li>
            <li>Under <b>Input Values</b>, specify the <a href="../Tokens-Regex/Tokens.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">token</a> and/or hard-coded values you want to use for each input field.<p class="ex"><b>Example</b>: In the following image, the input name <i>Age</i> represents the input field on the Output Order decision table. When the activity runs, the value of the <i>%(Age)</i> token is entered for the input.</p><p><img src="../../../Images/setupdecisiontable.png" /></p><p class="note"><b>Note</b>:&#160;When you select <b>&lt;Choose Value&gt;</b>, you see a text box, token picker, and three dots. The text box contains the input value. Note that when you enter a string value in the text box, you do not have to place double quotes around the string. The token picker lets you select a token. The three dots lets you select an item from a decision table's predefine list, if the decision table has one.</p></li>
            <li>Under <b>Output Values</b>, specify the name and <a href="../Tokens-Regex/Token-Tags.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">tag</a>&#160;of the single-value token that contains the result of the rule.<p class="ex"><b>Example</b>: In the following image, the output name <i>Decision</i> represents the output field <i>Decision</i> on the Output Order decision table. The token name <i>Decision</i> is used to represent the token that contains the result of the decision. This token looks like <i>%(RunRule_Decision)</i>.</p><p><img src="../../../Images/outputsetupdecisiontable.png" /></p></li>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include">Under <b>Rows to Return</b>, specify the number of results to return when more than one rule matches the inputs.<p class="ex"><b>Example</b>: The <b>Run  Rules</b> activity in the following image is configured to use "First 2 rows". That means, when two or more rules match, only the first two matches are returned. However, the output tokens (<i>%(ForEachRow_Decision)</i> and <i>%(ForEachRow_Offer)</i>)&#160;only store the results of the first match (i.e., "ACCEPT"&#160;and "Jetfiche Credit"). To get the results of the two matching rules, add a <a href="For-Each-Row.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">For Each Row</a> activity to iterate over each result. You can do that with the following designer configuration, where a sticky note is added for each result.</p><p><img src="../../../Images/decisiontableexample.png" /></p></li>
