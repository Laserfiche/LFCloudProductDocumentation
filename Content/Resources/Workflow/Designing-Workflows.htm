        <h1>Designing Workflows</h1>
        <h3>Planning</h3>
        <p>It is always important to plan in order to save time, re-work and errors due to incorrect starting assumptions. Before starting to put a process together, be sure that all pieces of the puzzle are known and understood. Ask yourself if you are automating a process or trying to solve a problem. If you see or experience an actual breakdown in the efficiency of the current process, then you should first solve the problem before automating the process.</p>
        <p>Be sure to contact all team members who will be affected by the automation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Department managers - They know the purpose of a process, and who handles what parts. May also be able to identify external contacts if those exist.</li>
            <li>Team members - They deal with the process in detail, and can help prevent missed steps or details.</li>
            <li>Upper management - There may be something that they need from, or would like to add to, an existing process that is not immediately discernible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Diagram the existing process with a flow diagram. Review the diagram with the team to make sure that everything is captured.</p>
        <h3>Designing</h3>
        <p>Using the diagram, determine where and when decisions happen, what activities are needed, and what data is involved in the process.</p>
        <p> Build the workflow based on those determinations. There are many pre-designed activities within Workflow to handle a multitude of actions, decision trees, and deadlines for action. As the workflow is built, test as needed to make sure that any complicated process is completed as expected.</p>

        <h3>Workflow example videos:</h3>
        <p>Workflow makes applying a standard naming convention in your repository a breeze. The workflow in this video renames documents based on two of their field values.</p>

        <p>This workflow runs behind the scenes and ensures that if the metadata on a folder changes, the metadata on the entries in the folder will also be automatically updated.</p>

        <p>To avoid moving documents around the repository, we recommend providing users with shortcuts to the document. This workflow creates three shortcuts to a document and distributes those shortcuts to various folders.</p>
