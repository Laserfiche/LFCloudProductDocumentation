        <h1>Comparing self-hosted Workflow and Workflow in Process Automation</h1>
        <p>For self-hosted deployments, Laserfiche Workflow is a desktop-based application where organizations can use a variety of drag and drop automation activities to automate repetitive patterns of tasks, such as routing documents for approval, renaming and moving documents, and updating third-party databases. For cloud systems, the workflow designer is incorporated as part of the process automation feature set and is the main engine to execute upon other components designed independently from workflows, such as decision tables, capture profiles, and lookup table queries.</p>
        <h2>Feature Comparison Tables</h2>
        <p>The below series of tables illustrate activity differences between cloud and self-hosted installations of Laserfiche Workflow</p>
