        <h1>Exporting Workflows and Their Components</h1>
        <p>Laserfiche lets you export workflows and the associated components of the workflows (like the starting events and rules)&#160;so that you can share them with others, as well as have a versioned copy of them offline. You can export a workflow as a .wfi file or save a workflow as a .wfx file. The .wfi file contains one or more workflows and the associated components of the workflows. The .wfx file contains one workflow. You also have the option to export a workflow event report, which is  a detailed summary of the actions a user performed in a specific workflow.</p>
        <p>To export workflows and their components:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select one or more workflows in the list on the <b>Manage</b> page.</li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <b>Download</b> in the toolbar.</p>
