        <h1>Importing Workflows and Their Components</h1>
        <p>Laserfiche allows you to import workflows and the associated components of the workflows (like the starting events and  rules)&#160;that someone has shared with you, as well as a versioned copy that you saved for yourself. You can import a workflow as .wfi file. A .wfi file contains one or more workflows and the associated components of the workflows.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b>&#160;At this time, .wfi files created in non-cloud versions of Laserfiche Workflow cannot be imported into the cloud.</p>
        <p>To import workflows and their components:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the <b>Manage</b> page.</li>
            <li>Select <b>Import</b> in the toolbar.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Browse</b> or drag and drop a file to select the .wfi file you want to import. Then click <b>Upload</b>.</li>
            <li>Complete each part that appears in the  wizard.	(See more below)	
			</li>
            <li>In <b>Import Summary</b>, review the details and click <b>Import</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Import Workflow Wizard Steps</h2>
        <p>Depending on the workflow you import, you have the option to replace existing connection profiles, workflows, and other automation elements in the .wfi file; change content; and discard parts of the content. The following bullets describe the steps you may encounter in the wizard.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>:&#160;To specify one action for many objects in any step, multi-select the objects and then use the drop-down at the bottom to specify the action.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Update Connection Profiles:&#160;Specify the <a href="Connection-Profiles.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">connection profile</a>, under <b>New Connection Profile</b>, with which you want each workflow to interact.</li>
            <li style="font-weight: normal;">Update Rules: Specify which rules to use that exist in the account under <b>New rule</b>.</li>
            <li>Update Condition Starting Events:&#160;Specify how to handle duplicate condition starting events (import with original name, import with new name, or discard)&#160;and whether to enable the rule after import. </li>
            <li>Update Starting Events Repositories:&#160;Specify the <a href="Connection-Profiles.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">connection profile</a>, under <b>Repository</b>, with which you want each condition starting event to interact. Because schedule starting events do not use connection profiles, you do not see this option after the Update Schedule Starting Events step.</li>
            <li>Update Schedule Starting Events:&#160;Like the Update Condition Starting Events step, specify the way you want to handle duplicates.</li>
            <li>Update Bots: Specify Bot replacements by selecting from the list under <b>New bot</b>.</li>
            <li>New Workflows:&#160;Specify how to handle name duplication of workflows that are connected via the&#160;Invoke Workflow activity (<b>Import</b> the workflows with the original names, <b>Import and Rename</b> the imported workflows, or <b>Discard</b> the imported workflows) and whether to <b>Publish</b> the workflows immediately.  </li>
            <li>Conflicting Workflows:&#160;Specify how to handle duplicate workflow  (<b>Import</b> the workflow with its original name, <b>Import and Rename</b> the imported workflow, or <b>Discard</b> the imported workflow) and whether to <b>Publish</b> the workflow.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>On the confirmation page, you will also be able to make adjustments to how Integrations, Capture, and Server attachments are handled by the imported workflow before finalizing the import.</p>
