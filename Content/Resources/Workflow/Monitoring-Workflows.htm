        <h1>Monitoring Workflows</h1>
        <p>The Workflow Monitor page provides an interface for reviewing performance and troubleshooting issues. From here, every instance (or execution) of a workflow definition can be reviewed, and terminated if required. Search for instances in progress to verify whether they are waiting for input or just stuck, and request termination of that instance if required. Review terminated instances to determine if there is an issue in a workflow definition in need of improvement. Finally, review completed instance performance, and locate possible bottlenecks in the process.</p>
        <p>For details about these features, refer to the following pages:</p>
