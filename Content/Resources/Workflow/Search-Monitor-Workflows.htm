        <h1>Monitoring and Searching Workflows</h1>
        <p>On the Workflows page in Laserfiche Process Automation, you can monitor workflow statuses and search for workflows satisfying specific conditions in the <b>Monitor</b> tab.</p>
        <p>From the navigation bar on the Monitor page, you can use the quick and custom search features to easily find one or more instances. The quick search feature provides various buttons along the top of the custom search pane to perform commonly used search criteria more easily. The custom search feature provides a complete search pane to let you define and create specific searches. </p>
        <p>You can also create Custom Filters, which you can open in the <b>My Workflow</b> drop-down in the custom search pane. To create a custom quick search:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter the search criteria in the custom search pane.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Save</b> at the bottom of the search pane.</li>
            <li>Type a name for the search.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Save</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>To find specific workflow instances</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Click on the magnifying glass icon in the left to search for specific workflow instances. You can use criteria like:<ul><li>Workflow name</li><li>Workflow status</li><li>Errors or warnings</li><li>Time</li><li>Starting information</li><li>Entry names involved</li><li>Entry paths involved</li></ul><p class="note"><b>Note</b>: When searching for initiators, users are identified by their email addresses, not their usernames. To identify instances started by a timer event, search for instances that were started by "Timer Event". To identify instances that were started by the Workflow service user (i.e. instances that were started by some action that Workflow performed in the repository), search for instances that were started by "ProcessAutomationUser".</p><p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Some item names may exceed the display width of a dropdown menu. In these cases, hovering over the name will display the full name.</p></li>
            <li>Once you've chosen your search criteria, click <b>Search</b> at the bottom of the left pane.<ul><li>At any point, you can also save a search for future use by clicking <b>Save</b> in the bottom left corner. Saved searches are available in the drop-down menu under <b>My workflows</b>.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Double-click on a particular instance's name in the search results to <a href="Viewing-an-Instance-Report.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">view an instance report</a>. </li>
            <li>You can repeat step 3 for multiple instances in the <b>Search Results</b> pane. Each instance you double-click on will be stored in the <b>Instances</b> view for future reference. You can also remove an instance from the <b>Instances</b> view if you no longer need to monitor it.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>To terminate instances</h3>
        <p>If you have any instances that have been idle for an extended period of time, you can select one or more instances and click the <b>Request Instance Termination</b> button at the top right of the list.</p>
