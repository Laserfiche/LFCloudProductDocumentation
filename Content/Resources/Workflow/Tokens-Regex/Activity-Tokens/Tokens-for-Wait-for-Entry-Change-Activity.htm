        <p>The "WaitforEntryChange" portion of the syntax changes to match the activity's name.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>: All non-alphanumeric characters, except underscores, are removed from the name. For example, if you rename the activity "Wait for (Approval)", the syntax for the Event Id token will be "%(WaitforApproval_Event Id)".</p>
        <div><b>*</b>When a wait condition is satisfied, two tokens are created that indicate who satisfied the condition (User Name and User SID). However, in the unlikely event that two users make changes to the entry within a short time period, the tokens indicate the user who made the changes that caused the wait condition to be evaluated, not necessarily the user who made the changes that caused the wait condition to be satisfied.</div>
