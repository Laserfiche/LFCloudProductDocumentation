        <h1>Date/Time Formatting</h1>
        <p>You can format tokens to automatically convert dates and times entered into them into specified formats. A standard format string is a single letter that represents a format that your data will automatically be converted to. A custom format string is a group of symbols that indicate the exact format for the information. Standard format strings are just shortcuts for frequently used formats that could also be achieved with custom format strings. You can type these specifiers directly in the tokens or use the token editor to insert the specifier and test the formatted token.</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Standard Date and Time Format Strings</p>
        <p>Standard date and format strings can be inserted into workflow tokens to format the values to match patterns determined by the regional settings of the computer where the Workflow Server is installed. View the regional settings in the control panel of the Workflow Server computer to determine how these strings will format your tokens.</p>
        <p class="ex"><b>Example</b>: To format regional settings, Sally uses "%(DateTime#"g"#)". When tested with "January 23, 2018, 0:00", she receives "1/23/2018 12:00 AM (English - United States)" or "23/01/2018 00:00 (French - France)".</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Custom Date and Time Format Strings</p>
        <p>You can also create custom strings to format dates and times to any combination of date and time formats. A popular use for this is to use dates extracted from your documents to create document names or folder paths according to a standardized system.</p>
        <p class="ex"><b>Example</b>: Sally wants to organize her documents into folders labeled with the last two digits of the year and the abbreviation for the month. She formats a token that contains the date accordingly and uses the <a href="../Activities/Rename-Entry.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Rename Entry</a> activity to name her folders. Sally uses "%(Date#"yy-MMM"#)". When tested with "January 23, 2018", she receives "18-Jan (English-United States)" or "18-jan (Portuguese-Brazil)".</p>
