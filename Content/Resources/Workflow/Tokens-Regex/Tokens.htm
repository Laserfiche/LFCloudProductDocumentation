        <h1>Tokens</h1>
        <p>Tokens are bits of text that are replaced with values when a workflow runs. This provides a way to use current information in your workflows. For example, you can use a date token in an email to display the current date when the workflow runs. The <a href="Using-Token-Editor.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">token editor</a> lets you modify the values in tokens temporarily.</p>
        <h2>Retrieving Starting Entry Tokens</h2>
        <p>You can select the <b>Retrieve starting entry tokens</b> option in the <MadCap:snippetText src="../../Snippets/Properties Pane.flsnp" /> to receive tokens about the entry that starts the workflow.</p>

        </p>
        <h2><a name="Multi-va"></a>Multi-value Tokens</h2>
        <p>Multi-value tokens are tokens that contain two or more values. You can produce a multi-value token in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a new token in the <a href="../Activities/Assign-Token-Values.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Assign Token Values</a> activity and make it a multi-value token.</li>
            <li>Create a new token in the <a href="../Activities/Token-Calculator.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Token Calculator</a> activity and apply a function to make it a multi-value token.</li>
            <li>Modify an existing token in the <a href="Using-Token-Editor.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">token editor</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Only the first value in a multi-value token can be returned. If you want to return more than one value, you must iterate over each value in the token. You can extract a specific value from a multi-value token using the <a href="Token-Index.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Apply Index</a> option in the <a href="Using-Token-Editor.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">token editor</a>.</p>
        <h2>List of Tokens</h2>
        <p>The following list describes the general tokens in a workflow.</p>
