        <h1>Viewing Workflow Details</h1>
        <p>To view an in-depth summary of a workflow, double-click a workflow on the <a href="Managing-Workflows.htm" title="Learn more about workflow manage page." alt="Learn more about workflow manage page.">Manage</a> page. This details page has a read-only overview of the workflow canvas, with performance metrics next to each activity, and options to view, attach, and remove starting rules from the workflow. Along the top of the details page, you can run, export, modify, revert, and delete workflows.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Using the drop-down in the top right of the page, navigate between the current published version and the current draft of the workflow. The first is the published version of the workflow, while the second is the working copy of the workflow that has not been published but has been saved. Along the bottom of the page, you can view a key about the performance metrics displayed on the page. Clear any checkboxes to reduce the details that appear on the workflow. For example, the following image shows that the workflow had one activity that started and completed successfully:</p>
