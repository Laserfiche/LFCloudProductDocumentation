        <h1>Viewing Usage Statistics</h1>
        <p>In addition to <a href="Viewing-an-Instance-Report.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">the instance report feature</a>, you can use the right pane in the Manage page to view a brief overview of the performance of the instances for a selected workflow. Each overview is presented on a card, which reports on the instances in a specific timeframe. The card has the total number of instances started, completed, and terminated, as well as the average duration of all the instances within the specific timeframe and the number of warnings (unexpected events that do not terminate the instance). For example, the following card provides an overview of the instances for the selected workflow in the last seven days:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Images/instanceoverview.png" />
        </p>
