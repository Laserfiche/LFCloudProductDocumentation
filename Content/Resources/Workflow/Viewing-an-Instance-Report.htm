        <h1>Viewing an Instance Report</h1>
        <p>You can interpret the progress and performance of your workflow instances using the instance reporting feature in the Instances tab. This report is available on the Monitor and Design  pages. From the navigation bar on the Monitor page, you can easily find any instance report using the nearby search feature, while from the navigation bar on the Design page, you can easily navigate between the associated workflow definition and the instance report.</p>
        <h2>Interpreting for an Instance Report</h2>
        <p>The various tabs in the instance reporting feature let you interpret the progress and performance of a workflow instance. The following table describes when you would use each tab.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
