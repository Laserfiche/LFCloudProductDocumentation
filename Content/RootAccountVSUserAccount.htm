        <h1>Signing In with an Email vs User Name</h1>
        <p>You can sign in to Laserfiche Cloud with 2 types of security credentials depending on how you want to interact with Laserfiche Cloud. To access Laserfiche Cloud Account Administration, sign in using an email address and password. To access your data stored in Laserfiche, sign in using a user name and password.</p>
        <p><b>Email address and password</b>
        </p>
        <p>When you first create a Laserfiche Cloud account, you provide an email address and password that will become the initial Laserfiche Cloud Account Administration administrator account. This email address and password grants access to the Laserfiche Cloud Account Administration web pages where you can perform such tasks as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating user name credentials that can sign in to view Laserfiche documents, access the Repository Administration site, and view audit information about the repository.</li>
            <li>Creating additional email/password administrator accounts.</li>
            <li>Viewing billing information for your Laserfiche Cloud account.</li>
            <li>Configuring a password policy that affects the user name/password account type.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note that email/password administrator accounts do not have more granular security controls. An administrator account has full access to all pages on the Laserfiche Cloud Account Administration site.</p>
        <p><b>User name and password</b>
        </p>
        <p>With a user name and password credential, you can sign in to Laserfiche Cloud to view content that you store in your Laserfiche repository. Depending on security settings, other tasks may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Configuring security that controls the level of access to repository content for other user name/password accounts.</li>
            <li>Defining the types of Laserfiche metadata that can be applied to content in the repository.</li>
            <li>Viewing reports on  changes to content stored in your Laserfiche repository.</li>
        </ul>
