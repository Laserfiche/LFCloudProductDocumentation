        <h1>Saved Searches and Custom Quick Searches</h1>
        <p>Saved searches and custom quick searches allow you to quickly perform </p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Saving"></a>Saving Searches</h2>
        <p>Once you have configured your search filter (see <a href="Advanced_Search.htm">Search Filters</a> for more information), you can click <b>Save</b> at the bottom left corner of the <b>Search&#160;Filters</b> pane. This will save the search so that you can quickly run it again later. In the <b>Save Search</b> dialog box, you can either select <b>Save as a new search</b> and type a name to save it, or select <b>Replace an existing search</b> to select a search you already saved and replace it with the current search. Click <b>OK</b>&#160;to save the search.</p>
        <p>Once you have saved a search, you can load it by opening the <b>Search Filters</b> pane and clicking <b>Saved Searches</b>. Select a search to load it, and then click <b>Search</b> to run that search.</p>
        <p>Most users will only be able to save the saved search for themselves; it will not display to other users. Users with the <b>Manage Repository Configuration</b> privilege can also create saved searches for entire groups, or for everyone.</p>
        <p>You can also delete a saved search by selecting it and clicking the <b>Delete</b> button (<img src="Resources/Images/advanced_search_delete_button.png" />).</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Tip</b>:&#160;If you create a date search where the search value is a relative time-frame, such as "in the past 5 days,"&#160;the search will automatically be updated whenever you run it. This allows you to quickly perform these searches without having to re-configure the date range each time.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Custom"></a>Custom Quick Searches</h2>
        <p>You add additional search types to <a href="Search.htm#Quick">quick search</a> to better meet your organization's needs.  For example, if your organization uses the <a href="Advanced_Search.htm#User" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Created By</a> search often, it can be added to the quick search bar so that you can simply type a user name and search. Any search type that can be configured using search syntax can be created as a custom quick search.</p>
