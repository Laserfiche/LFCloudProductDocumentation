        <h1>Saving to Laserfiche from Microsoft Office</h1>
        <p>Office Integration is a Laserfiche component that allows users to take advantage of Laserfiche features when working with Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and Outlook messages in their native Microsoft Office applications. Office Integration allows you to save Office files directly to your repository from the Office ribbon or toolbar.</p>
        <p>You can save a Microsoft Office file (with the exception of Outlook message files)&#160;to Laserfiche at any point in working with the file. You can save a new file to Laserfiche before you begin to work on it, you can save an in-progress file and continue to edit it after storing it in Laserfiche, or you can save a finished file to Laserfiche. If you are already working with an Office file in Laserfiche, you can also use Save to Laserfiche to save your changes. You do not need to be fully done with an Office file before you save it to Laserfiche. This allows you to take advantage of the features of Laserfiche while still actively working with the file.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b>&#160;In addition to saving directly from within an Office application, you can also import Microsoft Office documents as you would any other file type. See <a href="Importing_Files.htm">Importing Files from Your Computer</a> for more information.</p><iframe width="100%" height="557" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/officeintegrationoverview/Microsoft+Office+Integration.html"></iframe>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Installing the Office Integration</h2>
        <p>If you have never used Office Integration on your workstation before, you will need to do so before you can save documents to Laserfiche from Office. This can be done by opening any Microsoft Office document in your repository. You will automatically be prompted to download and install Office Integration. This will save a file to your computer, which you can run to install Office Integration. Once you have installed Office Integration, you may be prompted to close any Microsoft Office applications you have open, and/or to restart your computer. If you are not prompted to do so, you will need to close and re-open your Office applications after installing.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Saving to Laserfiche</h2>
        <p>Once you have installed Office Integration, you will see the Laserfiche ribbon or toolbar in your Microsoft Office applications. You can access the features of Office Integration from this ribbon or toolbar, including the Save to Laserfiche feature. </p>
        <p>While saving an Office document to Laserfiche, you can configure metadata about that document to categorize it or make it easier to search for in the future. See <a href="Metadata.htm">Metadata</a> for more information.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note</b>:&#160;Sending Microsoft Outlook email messages to Laserfiche has some additional features and options, and is covered in <a href="Sending_from_Outlook.htm">Sending Emails to Laserfiche from Microsoft Office</a>. However, the same Office Integration installation is used for both, so you do not need to reinstall Office Integration before using it with Outlook.</p>
