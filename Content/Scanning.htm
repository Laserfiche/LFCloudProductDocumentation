        <h1>Overview of Laserfiche Scanning</h1>
        <p>Laserfiche Scanning allows you to use a scanner to 
capture paper documents and store them in Laserfiche. While scanning, you can perform image enhancements such as rotating or deskewing a page, generate text from the scanned documents, and store additional information about the documents along with them. </p>
        <p>You can also use Laserfiche Scanning to import images already on your computer. For instance, if you have already scanned documents and saved them on your computer, you can use Scanning to perform image processing and store them in your repository.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Launching Scanning and Selecting a Scanning Mode</h2>
        <p>To begin scanning, click the <b>Scan</b> icon (<img src="Resources/Images/fb_scan_icon.png" />). You may be prompted to allow your browser to launch scanning.</p>
        <p>When you launch scanning, you will be prompted to choose web scanning, desktop scanning in basic mode, or desktop scanning in standard mode. Web scanning provides a streamlined interface for scanning one or more documents in your browser, without opening a separate application. Desktop scanning in basic mode provides a simplified interface recommended for scanning one document at a time. Desktop scanning in standard mode provides additional scanning options and is recommended for scanning multiple documents at a time. Both desktop scanning options will launch a separate application.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b>&#160;Web scanning is only available with the web client on Laserfiche Cloud, and does not support scanning images already on your computer. </p>
        <p>The first time you scan to Laserfiche from a particular computer, you will be prompted to install the scanning component. Once you have installed Web Scanning, you may be prompted to restart your computer. If you do not need to restart your computer, you will need to close and re-open your browser and then click the <b>Scan</b> icon again to begin scanning.</p>
