        <h1>Scanning, Reviewing, and Storing New Documents in Basic Mode</h1>
        <p>Once you have configured your image enhancements and text generation processes, and configured any default properties, you can begin scanning.</p>
        <p>In basic mode, you are limited to scanning one document at a time to a single destination. All pages scanned will be part of the same document. </p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Scanning a&#160;Document</h2>
        <p>To begin scanning, click the <b>Scan</b> button (<img src="Resources/Images/scanning_scan_button.png" />), or open the <b>File</b> menu and select <b>Start Scanning</b>. Scanning will begin immediately, using the scan source you specified. If you need to stop a scan in progress, click the <b>Stop Scanning</b> button (<img src="Resources/Images/scanning_stop_button.png" />). Otherwise, scanning will end on its own when it is complete.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Reviewing a Scanned Document</h2>
        <p>Once you have scanned a document, you can review its pages and (if you chose to generate text)&#160;its text. By default, the images will display in the center of the display. You can also click the mode button at the bottom of the screen to switch to viewing text, and you can use the arrow buttons to move from page to page.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Rescanning a Page</h2>
        <p>If a page was scanned incorrectly and you want to rescan it, you can do so before you store the document. Navigate to the page you want to rescan using the arrow buttons at the bottom of the display, then place the corresponding page in your scanner. Click the <b>Rescan</b> button (<img src="Resources/Images/scanning_rescan_button.png" />),&#160;or open the <b>File</b> menu and select <b>Rescan</b>, to rescan the page. The specified page will be rescanned and replaced.</p>
        <p><b>Note</b>:&#160;This feature is not recommended for use with the Universal Capture scan source.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Deleting a Page</h2>
        <p>You can delete a page from the document before sending it to the repository. For example, if you accidentally scan a page from the wrong document, you can remove it. Navigate to the page you want to delete using the arrow buttons at the bottom of the display, then open the <b>Edit</b> menu and select <b>Delete Page</b>. Note that deleted pages cannot be recovered.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Setting Metadata on a Scanned Document</h2>
        <p>Properties of your new document will be displayed to the right side of the display. You can customize the document's properties and metadata, including name, template and field information, and tags. See <a href="Metadata.htm">Metadata</a> for more information about document metadata and properties. </p>
        <p>You can also use tokens, which will be dynamically replaced with relevant information, in your default properties. For instance, if you want to include the date a document was scanned in its document name, you can use a token to do so automatically. You can select a token by pressing the token dropdown button (<b>&gt;</b>) and selecting from the list. See <a href="Tokens.htm">Tokens</a> for more information.</p>
        <p>You can configure the following default properties in the pane to the :</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To set a document name, type the name in the <b>Document name</b> option.</li>
            <li>To set a default template and field values, select the <b>Fields</b> tab. Choose a template and then fill in any field values.</li>
            <li>To add default tags, select the <b>Tags</b> tab. Select the tag you want to apply by default.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Storing a&#160;Scanned Document</h2>
        <p>Once you have reviewed the document and are ready to save it to Laserfiche, you can store the documents to Laserfiche. In basic mode, documents will always be saved to the folder that you had open when you launched Laserfiche Scanning. </p>
        <p>To store a document, do one of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the <b>Done</b> button (<img src="Resources/Images/scanning_done_button.png" />) in the toolbar to store the document and close Laserfiche Scanning.</li>
            <li>Click the <b>Store</b> button (<img src="Resources/Images/scanning_store_button.png" />) in the lower right to store the document and continue scanning.</li>
        </ul>
