        <h1>Wildcards and Operators</h1>
        <p>Wildcards and operators are ways of making searches more powerful by expanding or restricting the search results that will be returned. Wildcards represent unknown characters in a search, and operators are used to combine search terms or specify a search range.</p>
        <p>Wildcards can be used in any search type:&#160;<a href="Search.htm">search bar searches</a>, <a href="Advanced_Search.htm">search filter searches</a>, or <a href="Search_Syntax.htm">search syntax searches</a>. Operators are generally used with search syntax searches.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Wildcards</h2>
        <p>Wildcards are used to represent one or more unknown characters in a search term. They are useful for searching for all documents containing variations of a word or when you are not sure of the exact characters contained in a word. </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b>&#160;Some search filters restrict the type of characters you can type in a field, preventing you from using a wildcard. For instance, a date search can only contain numbers. If you want to use a wildcard with these types of searches, you can use search syntax.</p>

                    <td>*</td>
                    <td>(Asterisk) Represents zero or more missing characters. For example, govern*s would find "governors," "governments," and "governs."</td>

                    <td>?</td>

                    <td>[]</td>
                    <td>(Brackets) Brackets are also used as a wildcard for any single character. A limited set of replacement characters can be specified within the brackets. For example, gr[ae]y would find "gray" and "grey," but no others. </td>
                </tr>

                    <td>-</td>
                    <td>(Dash) Indicates a range of characters. For example, b[a-i]tter would find the words "batter," "better" and "bitter," but not "butter."</td>

                    <td>[0-9]</td>
                    <td>Represents any single digit number. For example, [0-9][0-9] would find any two-digit number (but not a one- or three-digit number), and [0-9][0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9]-[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9] would find a social security number.</td>

        <p class="ex"><b>Tip:</b> Wildcards may be combined. For example, br[a-o]ke* would find all of the following words: brake, braked, broke, broker, and broken.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Operators</h2>
        <p>Operators allow you to combine searches, or to restrict searches in certain ways. Each type of operator has a different purpose. Operators are generally used with search syntax searches.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Certain operators can only be used when performing specific types of searches. Limitations on the uses of a particular operator are included as a part of the description. </p>
        <h3><a name="Search"></a>Search Relationship Operators</h3>
        <p>Search syntax allows you to specify multiple search criteria; operators specify the relationship between each search criteria. Search results will then be limited according to the specified relationship. A list of the operators that can separate one search criteria from another is listed below.</p>

        <h3><a name="Parenthe" style="font-size: 10pt;"></a>Parentheses</h3>
        <p>Parentheses  can be used to group search criteria together. They are used to determine the order in which search criteria will be processed; they can be nested as deeply as you like. Laserfiche processes the innermost parentheses first and works outward. If there are no parentheses, NOT (-)&#160;searches will be evaluated first, then AND&#160;(&amp;)&#160;searches, and finally | (OR)&#160;searches. If adjacent operators are the same (for instance "A&#160;&amp;&#160;B&#160;&amp;&#160;C"), they will be evaluated left to right.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b><b>(</b> is a delimiter. You cannot search for a word or  phrase that includes this character unless you put the word or phrase inside quotation marks.</p>
        <h3><a name="Advanced"></a>Search Syntax Operators</h3>
        <p>
            <p>Different types of search syntaxes, except for text searches, use operators as a part of their syntax.
