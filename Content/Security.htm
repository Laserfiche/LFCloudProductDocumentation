        <h1>Security</h1>
        <p>Laserfiche offers many ways for you to protect your content. You can determine what users have access to what documents, and what they can do with those documents. You can also restrict users from performing certain actions across the entire repository. </p>
        <p>There are three basic types of security:&#160;<a href="Access_Rights.htm">access rights,</a> which allow you to secure documents and folders and their contents; <a href="Privileges.htm">privileges</a>, which allow you to grant or restrict the ability to perform certain tasks across the entire repository; and field and template rights, which allow you to secure field data. In addition, <a href="Security_Tags.htm">security tags</a> allow you to restrict access to documents on a document-by-document basis, and <a href="Annotations.htm">redactions</a> allow you to restrict access to information on specific parts of document pages.</p>
