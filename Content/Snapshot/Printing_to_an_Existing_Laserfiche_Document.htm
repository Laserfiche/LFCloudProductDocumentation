            <MadCap:concept term="Laserfiche" />Printing to an Existing Laserfiche Document</h1>
        <p>Before a Laserfiche document can be created by printing a file with Laserfiche Snapshot, a name 
 and storage location must be assigned to it. If the specified folder already contains a document with the 
 same name, you can print to that document instead of creating a new 
 one. This is handled differently depending on if you are using a local (including terminal server) printer or 
 a network printer. </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> To indicate you want to print to the currently opened Laserfiche imaged
 document, set the <b>Document name</b> option to the Current Document <a href="../../../../Trunk/English/User Guide/Content/Snapshot/Tokens.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">token</a>, which automatically assigns the 
 Current Folder token to the <b>Folder</b> option. Whether your print job will be stored in the current Laserfiche 
 document depends on your current document handling configuration. Snapshot does not automatically change the document handling option for you.</p>
        <p><b>Local Printing (Local and Terminal Server 
 Printer)</b>
        </p>
        <p>If Snapshot is configured to prompt for document settings when printing, you can choose from a number of options on the <a href="../../../../Trunk/English/User Guide/Content/Snapshot/document_handling_tab.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Document Handling tab</a> of the <a href="../../../../Trunk/English/User Guide/Content/Snapshot/laserfiche_snapshot_dialog_box.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Laserfiche Snapshot dialog box</a>. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Select the <b>Create a new document</b> option to create a new document if Snapshot finds an existing document with the same name.</li>
            <li>Select the <b>Insert new pages</b> option to append, prepend, or insert pages into an existing document.</li>
            <li>Select the <b>Replace existing pages</b> option to overwrite pages in an existing document.</li>
            <li>If you are inserting or replacing pages, you will be prompted 
 to decide if you want to merge the properties of the existing 
 document with those currently set in the Laserfiche Snapshot 
 dialog box. <ul><li>If you merge settings and a conflict occurs, 
 the existing document's settings will take precedence, and you can change them after they are merged. <a href="../../../../Trunk/English/User Guide/Content/Metadata/Field_Properties.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Independent fields and multi-value fields</a> added in this configuration (not currently assigned to the existing entry) will be added to the entry.</li><li>If you don't 
 merge settings, the configuration set in the Laserfiche 
 Snapshot dialog box will take precedence. </li></ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If Snapshot is configured to use default properties 
 when printing, you will not be prompted to choose how the documents are handled. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If Snapshot 
 is configured to insert or replace pages, the properties 
 of the existing document will be merged with the default properties configured 
 from the <a href="../../../../Trunk/English/User Guide/Content/Snapshot/laserfiche_snapshot_configuration_(current_user).htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Laserfiche Snapshot Configuration (Current User) dialog box</a>. If the same setting is configured to two different values, the existing document's settings will take precedence. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Remote Printing (Network Printer)</b>
        </p>
        <p>Users that print from a remote computer are not allowed to change the 
 settings assigned to Laserfiche documents or the manner in 
 which an existing document is handled. These settings are defined by an 
 administrator from the <a href="../../../../Trunk/English/User Guide/Content/Snapshot/laserfiche_snapshot_configuration_(shared_printer).htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Laserfiche Snapshot Shared Printer&#160;Configuration dialog box</a>. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If a document with the same name already exists and Snapshot 
 has not been configured to create a new document, the existing document's settings will be merged with the settings 
 configured from Snapshot. If these settings conflict, the existing document's settings will be used. </li>
        </ul>
