        <h1>Laserfiche Solution Marketplace Submission Guide</h1>
        <p>Welcome and thank you for your interest in contributing to the Laserfiche Solution Marketplace! Laserfiche has one of the most passionate and creative communities in the world, and we cannot wait for you to contribute and be a part of this community.</p>
        <p>This guide is a reference for submitting a solution to the marketplace. We recommend you have it open in a separate tab for reference while submitting the <a href="https://portal.laserfiche.com/w6303/forms/SolutionTemplateSubmission" class="Hyperlink" target="_blank" title="Click to go to the form" alt="Click to go to the form">Laserfiche Solution Marketplace Submission form</a>. Reach out to <a href="mailto:marketplace@laserfiche.com" class="Hyperlink" target="_blank" title="Click to email" alt="Click to email">marketplace@laserfiche.com</a> at any time for assistance with the process.</p>
        <h2>Overview of the Submission Process</h2>
        <h3>Prepare solution template files for upload</h3>
        <p class="ex"><b>Tip:</b> If you need help with any parts of this process, please reach out to <a href="mailto:marketplace@laserfiche.com" class="Hyperlink" target="_blank" title="Click to email" alt="Click to email">marketplace@laserfiche.com</a> for assistance, even prior to completing a submission.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
               Identify all the components that you want to include in your solution. For large processes, we suggest you look for natural breaks where you can split the process into multiple solution templates. Smaller templates are easier to work with. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Confirm your solution is on a supported system for the marketplace:
                <ul><li>
                        The Marketplace supports all editions of Laserfiche Cloud.
                    </li><li>
                        The Marketplace supports self-hosted versions 10.4 and higher. Only submissions for 10.4 or higher will be accepted.
                    </li></ul></li>
            <li>
               Export all sections of your solution:
                <p class="w"><b>Important:</b>  Ensure no confidential or personally identifiable information is included.

                        <p>The best briefcase files only include the file structure needed for supporting your template’s business process. We recommend doing one of the following:</p><ul><li>
                                If the structure is simple, re-build it without any extraneous entries. 
                            </li><li>
                                If the structure is too complex for re-building to be feasible, download and then re-upload it and then remove any extraneous entries.
                            </li></ul></li></ul></li>
            <li>
              Ensure all workflows, briefcases, and business processes are included, and have correct names for any reference or linked processes.</li>

        </h3>
        <p>Prepare information to market your solution including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A short, simple description of your solution template for use in search results and at the top of your listing page. This should explain what value your process provides in 1-2 sentences and under 140 characters.
            </li>
            <li>
                A longer, in-depth description of your solution template intended to explain to interested users what your solution does. We recommend including a process overview, the value in time or money savings this process saved your organization, relevant details about the process such as which organizational roles are included in the template, and any integrations included as part of the process.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sample screenshots of your forms and workflows. You do not need to include the entire process diagram; instead, showcase the primary value of your process.
            </li>
            <li>
                A logo for your organization. Laserfiche will use this to give credit to your organization for your submission.
            </li>
            <li>
                A short organizational bio of 300 characters or less that provides information about your organization.
            </li>
            <li><b>Optional:</b> You can upload case studies or other documents that explain the value of your solution template. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Mandatory Security Requirements</h2>
        <h3>Regional Design</h3>
        <p>The Solution Marketplace is designed for and developed for the United States of America market, and all industry tagging and other information is pursuant to that design. Check any solutions against your country's applicable laws and regulations. </p>
        <h3>Protecting Company Information</h3>
        <p>Before submitting a solution, please ensure you have not included any personal identifiable information (PII), company protected information, or other sensitive information. Such information may include, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
               Individuals’ names and contact information
            </li>
            <li>
              Names of employee teams
            </li>
            <li>
              Company logo or other images
            </li>
            <li>
              Databases
            </li>
            <li>
           Repository folders that are named with internal information
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>See full definition in the link here: <a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/ppii#:~:text=Further%2C PII is defined as,with other data elements%2C i.e.%2C" class="Hyperlink" target="_blank" title="Click to learn more" alt="Click to learn more">US Department of Labor definition of Personal Identifiable Information</a>. The definition of PII may differ depending on your region, country, or state.</p>
        <div class="ex">
            <p> <b>Tip</b>: In business processes where you may have names of teams and individuals, you can always choose to use the “/_initiator” variable. When you do this, all steps will redirect to initiator for easier testing. Also, placeholders like [CompanyName] make it easy for anyone who uses your process to know where they need to update with their own information.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Secure Scripts</h3>
        <p>Any scripts included in your solution need to be screened to confirm they contain no malicious code or dangerous scripts. Here is a reference on free security screening tools:</p>
        <p><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/Free_for_Open_Source_Application_Security_Tools" class="Hyperlink" target="_blank" title="Click to learn more" alt="Click to learn more">https://owasp.org/www-community/Free_for_Open_Source_Application_Security_Tools</a>
        </p>
        <p>One of the recommended options is to upload your scripts to GitHub and take advantage of their extensive free code scanning tools. </p>
        <h3>Licensing Requirements</h3>
        <p>If you have used any 3<sup>rd</sup> party or open-source code libraries or scripts, you must include licensing information so that any user of the template is aware of any licenses relevant to using the template. Please include license information in your documentation file and denote where open-source code or scripts are used with comments within your code. </p>
        <h2><a name="Creating"></a>Creating Documentation</h2>
        <p>Documenting how your solution works and how each component needs to be configured is extremely important. Laserfiche is a powerful tool, and processes can be created that include dozens of moving parts and different elements that work together. A solution without documentation is frustrating to use at best and completely unusable at worst. </p>
        <p>We’ve included a <a href="https://support.laserfiche.com/resources/4174/" class="Hyperlink" target="_blank" title="Click to learn more" alt="Click to learn more">best practice example of documentation</a> that includes the following parts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Overview:</b> An overview of what your solution does and how it works
            </li>
            <li><b>Requirements:</b> A list of requirements for your solution
            </li>
            <li><b>Components:</b> An overview of each form, business process, configuration, and workflow involved. Often it's helpful to list each component as a separate row in a table with columns for name, type, and description. 
            </li>
            <li><b>Folder Structure:</b> Explanations of the folder structure and paths used. Additionally, any locations where a user may want to update to their own existing folder path if a workflow does not automatically create a folder
            </li>
            <li><b>Metadata:</b> An overview of any metadata templates included
            </li>
            <li><b>Import:</b> Instructions on how to import files and in what order
            </li>
            <li><b>Instructions:</b> Any instructions needed to set up and begin using the solution, including specific instructions for setting up external integrations

        <h2><a name="Submitti"></a>Submitting for Both Laserfiche Cloud and Self-hosted Installations</h2>
        <p>If you would like to submit a solution that is compatible with both self-hosted and Laserfiche cloud, you will need access to both environments to test and confirm that your process works for both systems. Alternatively, you can request that Laserfiche assist with this testing, and we can review those requests on a case-by-case basis for approval. </p>
        <p>If you would like to submit a solution template for both, select Laserfiche Cloud on page 2 of the submission form.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Resources/Images/Laserfiche Solution Marketplace Submission Guide (Final)/Laserfiche Solution Marketplace_2.png" class="img_3" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: ;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: ;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: ;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: ;" alt="Self-hosted or Laserfiche Cloud choice" title="Select which system your solution is compatible with" />
        </p>
        <p>In the comments section on page 4, note that you would like to submit your process for both Laserfiche Cloud and self-hosted installations. </p>
        <p class="p_3" style="text-align: left;">

        </p>
        <p>Then include any business processes or workflow files separately for Laserfiche Cloud and self-hosted installations and mark them clearly with “Cloud – “ or “Self-hosted –“ on import. Example:</p>
        <p>

        <p>Provide an in-depth description of your solution template to explain to interested users what your solution does.  We recommend including a process overview, the value in time or money savings this process saved your organization, relevant details about the process such as which organizational roles are included in the template, and any integrations included as part of the process.
 Plan to combine this information with related screenshots to provide a comprehensive view of your solution template. </p>

        <h4>Primary Listing Image</h4>

            <img src="Resources/Images/Laserfiche Solution Marketplace Submission Guide (Final)/Laserfiche Solution Marketplace_15.png" alt="Primary Listing Image upload field" class="img_14" style="border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: ;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: ;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: ;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: ;" title="Upload your solution listing's image here" />
        </p>
        <p>We recommend using your  organization’s logo as the primary listing image, unless another image would better represent the solution. </p>
        <p>
            The most common alternative image would be a logo of a third-party company that your solution template has created an integration with. </p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Laserfiche will contact any third-party included in your integration to confirm we have the appropriate license to use their logo and imagery on our marketplace site. This may add time to the approval of your submission. </p>
        <p>
               Alternatively, you could use an icon or other small image that easily conveys the value of the solution. For example, an icon of a dog might be overlayed on a document icon for a pet license solution.
