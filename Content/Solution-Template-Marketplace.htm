        <h1>Solution Marketplace</h1>
        <p>The Solution Marketplace provides a variety of pre-built solutions  which let you quickly and easily automate your organization's processes. The marketplace houses over 120 templates that cover a broad range of topics, such as onboarding, invoicing, grant management, building maintenance, IT support, and more. Since more solutions are added to the marketplace all the time, often from members of the Laserfiche community, new templates cover timely topics such as return to work procedures and HEERF Student Aid. Additionally, there are solutions that cover design patterns and CSS and JavaScript examples that you can use when creating your own processes.</p>
        <p>These templates are out-of-the-box solutions that contain business processes, Laserfiche briefcases, workflows and more. You can import templates directly into your own Laserfiche environment. Once imported, click through the built-out templates to configure them with your organization's specific details.</p>
