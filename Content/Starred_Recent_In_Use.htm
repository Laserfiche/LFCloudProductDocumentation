        <h1>Starred Documents, Recent Documents, and Documents in Use</h1>
        <p>Laserfiche offers several ways to locate documents in addition to searching and browsing. You can star documents and folders for quick access later on, view a list of documents that you recently opened, and access a list of all the documents that you currently have locked or checked out for editing.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Starred Documents and Folders</h2>
        <p>You can star a document or folder that you want to quickly find again in the future. For instance, you might want to star a document that you frequently need to reference, or to star your own inbox folder for easy access. To star a document or folder, in the right pane of the Folder Browser, click the star icon next to the document or folder name. Alternately, right-click the document or folder and click <b>Add Star/Remove Star</b>. </p>
        <p>Starred documents and folders will be displayed in the <b>Starred</b> list in the upper left corner. A star will also display next to the document name in the Folder Browser list. Stars are specific to you; other users will not be able to see which documents you have starred.</p>
        <p>To remove a star, click the star next to the document or folder name again to toggle it off, or right-click the document or folder and select <b>Add Star/Remove Star</b>.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Recently Opened Documents</h2>
        <p>The <b>Recently Opened Documents</b> list in the upper left corner displays the ten documents that you opened most recently.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Documents in Use</h2>
        <p>You can find information about documents that you currently have locked or checked out for editing in the <b>Documents in Use</b> list in the upper left corner. The number of documents that you currently have locked or checked out will be displayed next to the list's name, allowing you to quickly tell if you have any documents reserved for you and to determine if you want to check them in, save them, or release their locks to make them available to others.</p>
        <p>Documents will automatically appear in this list if you have manually checked them out, if you have opened them for editing using the Microsoft Office Integration, or if you have made a change to their pages or metadata and not saved it yet. Documents that have been checked out will be displayed with a pencil icon, while documents that have been locked for editing will be displayed with a lock icon.</p>
        <p>Checked out documents can be checked back in (which will save your changes) by selecting the document and clicking the <b>Check In Document</b> icon or right-clicking and selecting <b>Check In Document</b>. If you want to discard your changes instead of saving them, you can instead select <b>Undo Check Out</b>.</p>
        <p>Locked documents can be saved by locating the document and saving its changes. If you want to discard your changes (for instance, if the document's lock was not correctly released), you can select the document and click the <b>Release Lock</b> icon.</p>
