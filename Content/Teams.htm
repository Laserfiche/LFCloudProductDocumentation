        <h1>Teams</h1>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Forms" />Teams provide a way to organize and route tasks in Laserfiche Forms. Tasks can be assigned to an entire team and be visible to all team members in a central list. From this list, team members can chose to complete tasks that interest them or managers can directly assign the tasks to team members. </p>
        <p class="ex"><b>Example:</b> The City of Scranton gets about 50 records requests a day. These requests come from community members who fill out a form on the city's website. The request forms are routed as tasks to the Records Department for processing. Instead of routing all these tasks to a single individual, the tasks go to the team's list of available tasks. (The tasks can also be found in each team member's list of available tasks.) Different team members interact with this list of team tasks in different ways. Sally skims through the lists for tasks that interest her and tasks concerning property rights (her area of specialty). She assigns all those tasks to herself so the rest of the team knows not to work on them. Mark has a hectic schedule, but he'll check the list when he has a few spare minutes and work on any tasks that can be completed quickly. Around mid-day, team manager Jan will go down the list and assign tasks directly to Jim and Lynn the most junior members of the team. </p>
