If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
        <p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</p>

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. </p>
        <p>You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</p>
        <p>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>
        <p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
        <p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>

You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
        <p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
        <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

            <p>of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</p>
            <p>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</p>
            <p>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</p>

            <p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</p>
            <p>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</p>
            <p>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</p>
            <p>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</p>
            <p>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</p>
            <p>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
            <p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</p>
            <p>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</p>
            <p>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</p>
            <p>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
            <p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</p>
            <p>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</p>
            <p>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,</p>
            <p>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</p>
            <p>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</p>
            <p>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</p>
            <p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</p>
            <p>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</p>
            <p>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
            <p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</p>
            <p>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</p>
            <p>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</p>
            <p>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</p>
            <p>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</p>
            <p>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</p>
            <p>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</p>

            <p>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</p>
            <p>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</p>
            <p>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
            <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</p>
            <p>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</p>
            <p>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</p>
            <p>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</p>
            <p>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</p>
            <p>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</p>
            <p>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</p>
            <p>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</p>
            <p>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</p>
            <p>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

        <p>2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
        <p>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
        <p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</p>
        <p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
        <p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and</p>
        <p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and</p>
        <p>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. </p>
        <p>You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</p>
        <p>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>
        <p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
        <p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
        <p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
        <p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
        <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

        <p>This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at: http://scripts.sil.org/OFL</p>
        <p>SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE</p>
        <p>Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007</p>
        <p>PREAMBLE</p>
        <p>The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide<br></br>development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation<br></br>efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and<br></br>open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership<br></br>with others.</p>
        <p>The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and<br></br>redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The<br></br>fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,<br></br>redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved<br></br>names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,<br></br>however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The<br></br>requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply<br></br>to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
        <p>DEFINITIONS</p>
        <p>"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright<br></br>Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may<br></br>include source files, build scripts and documentation.</p>
        <p>"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the<br></br>copyright statement(s).</p>
        <p>"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as<br></br>distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).</p>
        <p>"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,<br></br>or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the<br></br>Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a<br></br>new environment.</p>
        <p>"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical<br></br>writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.</p>
        <p>PERMISSION &amp; CONDITIONS</p>
        <p>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining<br></br>a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,<br></br>redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font<br></br>Software, subject to the following conditions:</p>
        <p>1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,<br></br>in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.</p>
        <p>2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,<br></br>redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy<br></br>contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be<br></br>included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or<br></br>in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or<br></br>binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.</p>
        <p>3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font<br></br>Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding<br></br>Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as<br></br>presented to the users.</p>
        <p>4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font<br></br>Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any<br></br>Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the<br></br>Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written<br></br>permission.</p>
        <p>5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,<br></br>must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be<br></br>distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to<br></br>remain under this license does not apply to any document created<br></br>using the Font Software.</p>
        <p>TERMINATION</p>
        <p>This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are<br></br>not met.</p>

#	Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its

#	NO WARRANTY
#	
#	The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the

#	to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
#	program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,

#	performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of

#	any right of any third party.
#

#	the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
#	otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
#	
#	Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other

#	foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
#	"use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
#	modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
#	production of secondary products from the program.
#	
#	In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
#	modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
#	any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
#	grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
#	writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted

</pre><h3>4. Time Zone Database</h3><p>ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from <a href="http://www.iana.org/time-zones" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">
			Time Zone Database</a> for its time zone support. The ownership of the TZ database is explained

		Database</a> section 7.</p><pre>7.  Database Ownership

The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF
document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work
that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the public
domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do not apply

        <p>The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms
			of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The
			Source Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this License
			or a future version of this License released under Section 6.1,
			and You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
			distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or
			restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.
			However, You may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in
			Section 3.5.
		</p>
        <h4 id="section-3.2">3.2. Availability of Source Code.</h4>
        <p>Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be made available in
			Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable
			version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
			Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
			must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
			available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
			Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
			that the Source Code version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution
			Mechanism is maintained by a third party.
		</p>
        <h4 id="section-3.3">3.3. Description of Modifications.</h4>
        <p>You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting the
			changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change. You must include a
			prominent statement that the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
			Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in
			(a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related documentation
			in which You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered Code.
		</p>
        <h4 id="section-3.4">3.4. Intellectual Property Matters</h4>
        <h4 id="section-3.4-a">(a) Third Party Claims</h4>
        <p>If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property
			rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections
			2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a
			text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the
			party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If
			Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
			Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in
			all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
			notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
			received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.
		</p>
        <h4 id="section-3.4-b">(b) Contributor APIs</h4>
        <p>If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor
			has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that
			<abbr>API</abbr>, Contributor must also include this information in the
			<strong class="very-strong">legal</strong> file.
		</p>
        <h4 id="section-3.4-c">(c) Representations.</h4>
        <p>Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4
			(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications
			are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the
			rights conveyed by this License.
		</p>
        <h4 id="section-3.5">3.5. Required Notices.</h4>
        <p>You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
			Source Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to
			its structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)
			where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created one or more
			Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in
			Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation
			for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to
			Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
			or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so
			only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
			must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
			obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
			and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor
			as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
		</p>
        <h4 id="section-3.6">3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</h4>
        <p>You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of Sections
			3.1, 3.2,
			3.3, 3.4 and
			3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You include a
			notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the terms
			of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations
			of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
			notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
			recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of
			Covered Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
			different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this
			License and that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
			recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If
			You distribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely
			clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
			Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
			every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
			a result of any such terms You offer.
		</p>
        <h4 id="section-3.7">3.7. Larger Works.</h4>
        <p>You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the
			terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
			You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.
		</p>
        <h4 id="section-4">4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</h4>
        <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to
			some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must:
			(a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe
			the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the
			<strong class="very-strong">legal</strong> file described in Section
			3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the Source Code.
			Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
			sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
		</p>
        <h4 id="section-5">5. Application of this License.</h4>
        <p>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice in
			Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.
		</p>
        <h4 id="section-6">6. Versions of the License.</h4>
        <h4 id="section-6.1">6.1. New Versions</h4>
        <p>Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or new versions
			of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
		</p>
        <h4 id="section-6.2">6.2. Effect of New Versions</h4>
        <p>Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, You may
			always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose to use such
			Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape.
			No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
			created under this License.
		</p>
        <h4 id="section-6.3">6.3. Derivative Works</h4>
        <p>If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in order to
			apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)
			rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL",
			"NPL" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license (except to note that
			your license differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of
			the license contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public
			License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the
			notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to
			be modifications of this License.)

				ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
				by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
				that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
				ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part

            <p>The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
				It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
				The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
				ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
				but is also freely distributable.</p>
            <p>The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
				To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
				been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
				"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
				resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
				GIF decoders.</p>
            <p>We are required to state that

        <p>worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</p>
        <p>(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,</p>
        <p>use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,</p>
        <p>where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable</p>

        <p>Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)</p>
        <p>with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You</p>
        <p>institute patent litigation against any entity (including a</p>
        <p>cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work</p>
        <p>or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</p>

        <p>granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</p>
        <p>as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</p>

        <p>meet the following conditions:</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or</p>
        <p>Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</p>
        <p>stating that You changed the files; and</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</p>
        <p>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and</p>
        <p>attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,</p>
        <p>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</p>
        <p>the Derivative Works; and</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its</p>
        <p>distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</p>
        <p>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</p>
        <p>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</p>
        <p>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</p>
        <p>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</p>
        <p>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</p>
        <p>documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</p>
        <p>within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</p>
        <p>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</p>
        <p>of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</p>
        <p>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</p>
        <p>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</p>
        <p>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</p>
        <p>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</p>
        <p>as modifying the License.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</p>
        <p>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</p>
        <p>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</p>
        <p>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</p>
        <p>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</p>
        <p>the conditions stated in this License.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</p>
        <p>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</p>
        <p>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</p>
        <p>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</p>
        <p>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</p>
        <p>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</p>
        <p>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</p>
        <p>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</p>
        <p>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</p>
        <p>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</p>
        <p>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,</p>
        <p>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</p>
        <p>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</p>
        <p>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</p>
        <p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</p>
        <p>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</p>
        <p>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</p>
        <p>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</p>
        <p>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</p>
        <p>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</p>
        <p>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</p>
        <p>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</p>
        <p>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</p>
        <p>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</p>
        <p>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</p>
        <p>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</p>
        <p>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</p>
        <p>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</p>
        <p>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</p>
        <p>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</p>
        <p>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</p>
        <p>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</p>
        <p>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</p>
        <p>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</p>
        <p>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</p>
        <p>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

        <p>represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes</p>
        <p>of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain</p>
        <p>separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,</p>
        <p>the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</p>
        <p>"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including</p>

        <p>submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner</p>
        <p>or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of</p>
        <p>the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"</p>

        <p>and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the</p>
        <p>Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but</p>
        <p>excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise</p>
        <p>designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."</p>
        <p>"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity</p>
        <p>on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and</p>

        <p>2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</p>
        <p>this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</p>
        <p>worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</p>
        <p>copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,</p>
        <p>publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the</p>

        <p>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</p>
        <p>this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</p>
        <p>worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</p>
        <p>(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,</p>
        <p>use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,</p>
        <p>where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable</p>
        <p>by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their</p>
        <p>Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)</p>
        <p>with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You</p>
        <p>institute patent litigation against any entity (including a</p>
        <p>cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work</p>
        <p>or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</p>
        <p>or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses</p>
        <p>granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</p>
        <p>as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
        <p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</p>
        <p>Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without</p>
        <p>modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You</p>
        <p>meet the following conditions:</p>
        <p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or</p>
        <p>Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
        <p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</p>
        <p>stating that You changed the files; and</p>
        <p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</p>
        <p>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and</p>
        <p>attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,</p>
        <p>excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</p>
        <p>the Derivative Works; and</p>
        <p>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its</p>
        <p>distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</p>
        <p>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</p>
        <p>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</p>
        <p>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</p>
        <p>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</p>
        <p>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</p>
        <p>documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</p>
        <p>within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</p>
        <p>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</p>
        <p>of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</p>
        <p>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</p>
        <p>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</p>
        <p>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</p>
        <p>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</p>
        <p>as modifying the License.</p>
        <p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</p>
        <p>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</p>
        <p>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</p>
        <p>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</p>
        <p>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</p>
        <p>the conditions stated in this License.</p>
        <p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</p>
        <p>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</p>
        <p>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</p>
        <p>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</p>
        <p>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</p>
        <p>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
        <p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</p>
        <p>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</p>
        <p>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</p>
        <p>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
        <p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</p>
        <p>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</p>
        <p>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,</p>
        <p>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</p>
        <p>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</p>
        <p>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</p>
        <p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</p>
        <p>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</p>
        <p>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
        <p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</p>
        <p>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</p>
        <p>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</p>
        <p>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</p>
        <p>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</p>
        <p>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</p>
        <p>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</p>
        <p>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</p>
        <p>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</p>
        <p>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</p>
        <p>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
        <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</p>
        <p>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</p>
        <p>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</p>
        <p>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</p>
        <p>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</p>
        <p>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</p>
        <p>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</p>
        <p>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</p>
        <p>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</p>
        <p>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

        <p>MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS</p>
        <p>MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY</p>
        <p>These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates). They apply to the software named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft services or updates for the software, except to the extent those have different terms.</p>
        <p>IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.</p>
        <p>1.    INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.</p>
        <p>You may install and use any number of copies of the software to develop and test your applications.</p>
        <p>2.    THIRD PARTY COMPONENTS. The software may include third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) accompanying the software.</p>
        <p>3.    ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.</p>
        <p>a.     DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  The software is comprised of Distributable Code. “Distributable Code” is code that you are permitted to distribute in applications you develop if you comply with the terms below.</p>
        <p>i.      Right to Use and Distribute.</p>
        <p>·        You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.</p>
        <p>·        Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your applications to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those applications.</p>
        <p>ii.     Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must</p>
        <p>·        use the Distributable Code in your applications and not as a standalone distribution;</p>
        <p>·        require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement; and</p>
        <p>·        indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your applications, except to the extent that any claim is based solely on the unmodified Distributable Code.</p>
        <p>iii.   Distribution Restrictions. You may not</p>
        <p>·        use Microsoft’s trademarks in your applications’ names or in a way that suggests your applications come from or are endorsed by Microsoft; or</p>
        <p>·        modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An “Excluded License” is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution of code, that (i) it be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or (ii) others have the right to modify it.</p>
        <p>4.    DATA.</p>
        <p>a.     Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve our products and services.  You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described in the software documentation.  There are also some features in the software that may enable you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your applications together with Microsoft’s privacy statement. Our privacy statement is located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn more about data collection and its use from the software documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software operates as your consent to these practices.</p>
        <p>b.    Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all customers effective May 25, 2018, at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/gdpr.</p>
        <p>5.    SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not</p>
        <p>·        work around any technical limitations in the software;</p>
        <p>·        reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the software, except and to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included in the software;</p>
        <p>·        remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;</p>
        <p>·        use the software in any way that is against the law; or</p>
        <p>·        share, publish, rent or lease the software, provide the software as a stand-alone offering for others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.</p>
        <p>6.    EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use. For further information on export restrictions, visit www.microsoft.com/exporting.</p>
        <p>7.    SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.</p>
        <p>8.    ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.</p>
        <p>9.    APPLICABLE LAW.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law applies to interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live apply to all other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.</p>
        <p>10. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions apply to you:</p>
        <p>a)    Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this agreement is intended to affect those rights.</p>
        <p>b)    Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your specific device or software.</p>
        <p>c)    Germany and Austria.</p>
        <p>(i)        Warranty. The software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany it. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in relation to the software.</p>
        <p>(ii)       Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the Product Liability Act, as well as in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable according to the statutory law.</p>
        <p>Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence</p>
        <p>11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
        <p>12. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.</p>
        <p>This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
        <p>It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.</p>

        <p>MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS</p>
        <p>MICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY</p>
        <p>These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft</p>
        <p>·         updates,</p>
        <p>·         supplements,</p>
        <p>·         Internet-based services, and</p>
        <p>·         support services</p>
        <p>for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply.</p>
        <p>BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THEM, DO NOT USE THE SOFTWARE.</p>
        <p>IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE PERPETUAL RIGHTS BELOW.</p>
        <p>1.    INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.</p>
        <p>a.    Installation and Use. You may install and use any number of copies of the software to design, develop and test your programs.  You may modify, copy, distribute or deploy any .js files contained in the software as part of your programs.</p>
        <p>b.    Third Party Programs. The software may include third party programs that Microsoft, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement. Notices, if any, for the third party program are included for your information only.</p>
        <p>2.    ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.</p>
        <p>a.    DISTRIBUTABLE CODE.  In addition to the .js files described above, the software is comprised of Distributable Code. “Distributable Code” is code that you are permitted to distribute in programs you develop if you comply with the terms below.</p>
        <p>i.      Right to Use and Distribute.</p>
        <p>·         You may copy and distribute the object code form of the software.</p>
        <p>·         Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.</p>
        <p>ii.    Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must</p>
        <p>·         use the Distributable Code in your programs and not as a standalone distribution;</p>
        <p>·         require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement;</p>
        <p>·         display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and</p>
        <p>·         indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, related to the distribution or use of your programs.</p>
        <p>iii.   Distribution Restrictions. You may not</p>
        <p>·         alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable Code;</p>
        <p>·         use Microsoft’s trademarks in your programs’ names or in a way that suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;</p>
        <p>·         include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs; or</p>
        <p>·         modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that</p>
        <p>·         the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or</p>
        <p>·         others have the right to modify it.</p>
        <p>3.    SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not</p>
        <p>·         work around any technical limitations in the software;</p>
        <p>·         reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;</p>
        <p>·         publish the software for others to copy;</p>
        <p>·         rent, lease or lend the software; or</p>
        <p>·         transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.</p>
        <p>4.    BACKUP COPY. You may make one backup copy of the software. You may use it only to reinstall the software.</p>
        <p>5.    DOCUMENTATION. Any person that has valid access to your computer or internal network may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference purposes.</p>
        <p>6.    EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.</p>
        <p>7.    SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is “as is,” we may not provide support services for it.</p>
        <p>8.    ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.</p>
        <p>9.    APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
        <p>a.    United States. If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.</p>
        <p>b.    Outside the United States. If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.</p>
        <p>10.  LEGAL EFFECT. This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.</p>
        <p>11.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS-IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS OR STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
        <p>FOR AUSTRALIA – YOU HAVE STATUTORY GUARANTEES UNDER THE AUSTRALIAN CONSUMER LAW AND NOTHING IN THESE TERMS IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS.</p>
        <p>12.  LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.</p>
        <p>This limitation applies to</p>
        <p>·         anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and</p>
        <p>·         claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
        <p>It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.</p>
        <p>Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this agreement are provided below in French.</p>
        <p>Remarque : Ce logiciel étant distribué au Québec, Canada, certaines des clauses dans ce contrat sont fournies ci-dessous en français.</p>
        <p>EXONÉRATION DE GARANTIE. Le logiciel visé par une licence est offert « tel quel ». Toute utilisation de ce logiciel est à votre seule risque et péril. Microsoft n’accorde aucune autre garantie expresse. Vous pouvez bénéficier de droits additionnels en vertu du droit local sur la protection des consommateurs, que ce contrat ne peut modifier. La ou elles sont permises par le droit locale, les garanties implicites de qualité marchande, d’adéquation à un usage particulier et d’absence de contrefaçon sont exclues.</p>
        <p>LIMITATION DES DOMMAGES-INTÉRÊTS ET EXCLUSION DE RESPONSABILITÉ POUR LES DOMMAGES. Vous pouvez obtenir de Microsoft et de ses fournisseurs une indemnisation en cas de dommages directs uniquement à hauteur de 5,00 $ US. Vous ne pouvez prétendre à aucune indemnisation pour les autres dommages, y compris les dommages spéciaux, indirects ou accessoires et pertes de bénéfices.</p>
        <p>Cette limitation concerne :</p>
        <p>·         tout ce qui est relié au logiciel, aux services ou au contenu (y compris le code) figurant sur des sites Internet tiers ou dans des programmes tiers ; et</p>
        <p>·         les réclamations au titre de violation de contrat ou de garantie, ou au titre de responsabilité stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.</p>
        <p>Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.</p>
        <p>EFFET JURIDIQUE. Le présent contrat décrit certains droits juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d’autres droits prévus par les lois de votre pays. Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que vous confèrent les lois de votre pays si celles-ci ne le permettent pas.</p>

        <p>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</p>
        <p>Version 3, 29 June 2007</p>
        <p>Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;</p>
        <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
        <p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>
        <p>0. Additional Definitions.</p>
        <p>As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
        <p>"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below. </p>
        <p>An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library. </p>
        <p>A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked Version".</p>
        <p>The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>
        <p>The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>
        <p>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>
        <p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>
        <p>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</p>
        <p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:</p>
        <p>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</p>
        <p>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.</p>
        <p>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</p>
        <p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>
        <p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.</p>
        <p>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>
        <p>4. Combined Works.</p>
        <p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:</p>
        <p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.</p>
        <p>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>
        <p>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>
        <p>d) Do one of the following:</p>
        <p>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.</p>
        <p>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computersystem, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.</p>
        <p>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)</p>
        <p>5. Combined Libraries.</p>
        <p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:</p>
        <p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.</p>
        <p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>
        <p>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</p>
        <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
        <p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.</p>
        <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p>SPECIAL EXCEPTION GRANTED BY COPYRIGHT HOLDERS</p>
        <p>As a special exception, copyright holders give you permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you must extend this exception to your version of the library.</p>

        <p>Important points about our license agreement</p>
        <p>The PDF4NET library is licensed per developer. One license can be used on multiple computers as long as it is used by the same developer, and it can not be used concurently or shared by other developers.</p>
        <p>When using the PDF4NET library for desktop development (native Windows applications, WinForms, WPF, UWP, Xamarin.Mac, .NET Core), the library is licensed royalty free. You pay to use during the development time to create your final product. You do not need to pay any other fees when you distribute the PDF4NET library with your final product.</p>
        <p>When using the PDF4NET library for mobile development (Android and iOS), the library is licensed royalty free. You pay to use during the development time to create your final product. You do not need to pay any other fees when you distribute the PDF4NET library with your final product.</p>
        <p>When using the PDF4NET library for server-side development (ASP.NET web applications, .NET Core, Windows services), the library is licensed deployment free. You pay to use during the development time to create your final product. You do not need to pay any other fees when you deploy the PDF4NET library along with your final product on other servers.</p>
        <p>This license does NOT ALLOW you to distribute the PDF4NET library for use in development. This requires an OEM distribution license. If you want to do so, please contact us.</p>

        <p>Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)</p>
        <p>with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You</p>
        <p>institute patent litigation against any entity (including a</p>
        <p>cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work</p>
        <p>or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</p>

        <p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</p>
        <p>stating that You changed the files; and</p>
        <p>(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</p>
        <p>that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and</p>
        <p>attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,</p>

        <p>the Derivative Works; and</p>
        <p>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its</p>
        <p>distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</p>
        <p>include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</p>
        <p>within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</p>
        <p>pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</p>
        <p>of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</p>
        <p>as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</p>
        <p>documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</p>
        <p>within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</p>
        <p>wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</p>
        <p>of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</p>
        <p>do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</p>
        <p>notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</p>
        <p>or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</p>
        <p>that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</p>
        <p>as modifying the License.</p>
        <p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</p>
        <p>may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</p>
        <p>for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</p>
        <p>for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</p>
        <p>reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</p>
        <p>the conditions stated in this License.</p>
        <p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</p>
        <p>any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</p>
        <p>by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</p>
        <p>this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</p>
        <p>the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</p>
        <p>with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
        <p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</p>
        <p>names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</p>
        <p>except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</p>
        <p>origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
        <p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</p>
        <p>agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</p>
        <p>Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,</p>
        <p>WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</p>
        <p>implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</p>
        <p>of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</p>
        <p>PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</p>
        <p>appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</p>
        <p>risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
        <p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</p>
        <p>whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</p>
        <p>unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</p>
        <p>negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</p>
        <p>liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</p>
        <p>incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</p>
        <p>result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</p>
        <p>Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</p>
        <p>work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</p>
        <p>other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</p>
        <p>has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
        <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</p>
        <p>the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</p>
        <p>and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</p>
        <p>or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</p>
        <p>License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</p>
        <p>on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</p>
        <p>of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</p>
        <p>defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</p>
        <p>incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</p>
        <p>of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>

        <p>2. License Grants and Conditions</p>
        <p>--------------------------------</p>
        <p>2.1. Grants</p>
        <p>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:</p>
        <p>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and</p>
        <p>(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.</p>
        <p>2.2. Effective Date</p>
        <p>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.</p>
        <p>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</p>
        <p>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:</p>
        <p>(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or</p>
        <p>(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or</p>
        <p>(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.</p>
        <p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).</p>
        <p>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</p>
        <p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).</p>
        <p>2.5. Representation</p>
        <p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</p>
        <p>2.6. Fair Use</p>
        <p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.</p>
        <p>2.7. Conditions</p>
        <p>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.</p>
        <p>3. Responsibilities</p>
        <p>-------------------</p>
        <p>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</p>
        <p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.</p>
        <p>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</p>
        <p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>
        <p>(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</p>
        <p>(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p>
        <p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</p>
        <p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).</p>
        <p>3.4. Notices</p>
        <p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>
        <p>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</p>
        <p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</p>
        <p>---------------------------------------------------</p>
        <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
        <p>5. Termination</p>
        <p>--------------</p>
        <p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.</p>
        <p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.</p>
        <p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>

The provisions of sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 will survive any termination of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>6. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</p>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE AND OUR RESELLERS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR THE CODE IT PRODUCES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT IS NOT TECHNICALLY PRACTICABLE FOR US TO DO SO.</p>
        <p>7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITIES</p>
        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE OR OUR RESELLERS BE LIABLE UNDER ANY LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LAW) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR THE CODE IT PRODUCES OR ANY OTHER SUBJECT MATTER RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF WE OR OUR RESELLERS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN ANY CASE, OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATER RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (I) THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE OR (II) FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500).</p>
        <p>8. VERIFICATION</p>
        <p>We or a certified auditor acting on Our behalf, may, upon Our reasonable request and at Our expense, audit You with respect to the use of the Software. Such audit may be conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Your place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Your facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Your business activities. We shall not remove, copy, or redistribute any electronic material during the course of an audit. If an audit reveals that You are using the Software in a way that is in material violation of the terms of this Agreement, then You shall pay Our reasonable costs of conducting the audit. In the case of a material violation, You agree to pay Us any amounts owing that are attributable to the unauthorized use. In the alternative, We reserve the right, at Our discretion, to terminate the licenses for the Software, in addition to any other remedies available under law. This Section shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement for a period of two (2) years.</p>
        <p>9. PAYMENT AND TAXES</p>
        <p>If credit has been extended to You by Us, all payments under this Agreement are due within thirty (30) days of the date We mail an invoice to You. If We have not extended credit to You, You shall be required to make payment concurrent with the delivery of the Software by Us. Any value added tax, use tax, sales tax or similar tax (“Transaction Taxes”) shall be your sole responsibility. Each party shall pay all taxes (including, but not limited to, taxes based upon its income) or levies imposed on it under applicable laws, regulations and tax treaties as a result of this Agreement and any payments made hereunder (including those required to be withheld or deducted from payments); provided that You shall be responsible for all Transactions Taxes and shall pay or reimburse Us for the same upon invoice. Each party shall furnish evidence of such paid taxes as is sufficient to enable the other party to obtain any credits available to it, including original withholding tax certificates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Software ordered through Our resellers is subject to the fees and payment terms set forth on the applicable reseller invoice.</p>
        <p>10. SUPPORT AND UPDATES</p>
        <p>You are not entitled to any support for the Software under this Agreement. All support must be purchased separately and will be subject to the terms and conditions contained in the Sencha support agreement. You are entitled to receive minor version updates to the Software (i.e., versions identified as follows (X.Y, X.Y+1). You are not entitled to receive major version updates (i.e., X.Y, X+1.Y) or bug fix updates to the Software (X.Y.Z, X.Y.Z+1), unless purchased independently of this license.</p>
        <p>11. MISCELLANEOUS</p>
        <p>The license granted herein applies only to the version of the Software available when purchased (or downloaded in the case of Sencha Touch) in connection with the terms of this Agreement, and to any updates and/or upgrades to which you may be entitled. Any previous or subsequent license granted to You for use of the Software shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the agreement entered in connection with purchase or download of that version of the Software. You agree that you will comply with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to the Software, including without limitation all export and re-export control laws and regulations.</p>
        <p>While redistributing the Software or Modifications thereof as part of Your Application, You may choose to offer acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this Agreement. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on our behalf. You shall indemnify Us and our resellers, or at Our option, defend Us and our resellers against any claim, suit or proceeding brought against Us or our resellers (i) arising by reason of Your accepting any such support, warranty, indemnity or additional liability; or (ii) arising out of the use, reproduction or distribution of Your Application, except to the extent such claim is solely based on the inclusion of the Software therein. Further, You agree only to distribute the Software pursuant to an enforceable written agreement for Our benefit that includes all the limitations and restrictions of this Agreement and is as protective of Us and Software as is this Agreement. For clarity, for Software for which you have paid a fee, You must purchase Designated User licenses for each contractor or consultant who uses the Software to create an Application on your behalf (including system integrators), whether or not such contractor or consultant has its own license to the Software.</p>
        <p>You agree to be identified as a customer of Ours and You agree that We may refer to You by name, trade name and trademark, if applicable, and may briefly describe Your business in our marketing materials and web site.</p>
        <p>You may not assign or transfer this Agreement without Our prior written consent. This Agreement may be assigned by Us in whole or part and will inure to the benefit of Our successors and assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any instance in which You transfer ownership of an Application on a work for hire basis, You may assign licenses for the total Designated Users that have used the Software to develop said Application under this Agreement to another party (Assignee) provided (i) you provide written notice to Us prior to the effective date of such assignment; and (ii) there is a written agreement, wherein the Assignee accepts the terms of this Agreement. Upon any such transfer, the Assignee may appoint new Designated Users.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge that this Agreement is complete and is the exclusive representation of our agreement. No oral or written information given by Us, Our resellers, or otherwise on Our behalf shall create a warranty or collateral contract, or in any way increase the scope of this Agreement in any way, and You may not rely on any such oral or written information. No term or condition contained in any purchase order shall have any force or effect.</p>
        <p>There are no implied licenses or other implied rights granted under this Agreement, and all rights, save for those expressly granted hereunder, shall remain with Us and our licensors. In addition, no licenses or immunities are granted to the combination of the Software and/or Modifications, as applicable, with any other software or hardware not delivered by Us or Our resellers to You under this Agreement. Your rights under this Agreement apply only to Software, Modifications, and/or Applications for which all Designated Users are duly licensed hereunder.</p>
        <p>If any provision in this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid, such provision shall be deemed omitted; the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If any remedy provided is determined to have failed for its essential purpose, all limitations of liability and exclusions of damages set forth in this Agreement shall remain in effect.</p>
        <p>This Agreement may be modified only by a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each party. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement may not be deemed a waiver of that or any other provision of this Agreement.</p>
        <p>This Agreement is governed by the law of the State of California, United States (notwithstanding conflicts of laws provisions), and all parties irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the state or federal courts of the State of California and further agree to commence any litigation which may arise hereunder in the state or federal courts located in the judicial district of San Mateo County, California, US.</p>
        <p>If the Software or any related documentation is licensed to the U.S. Government or any agency thereof, it will be considered to be “commercial computer software” or “commercial computer software documentation,” as those terms are used in 48 CFR § 12.212 or 48CFR § 227.7202, and is being licensed with only those rights as are granted to all other licensees as set forth in this Agreement.</p>

        <p>Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;</p>
        <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
        <p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>
        <p>0. Additional Definitions.</p>
        <p>As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
        <p>“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>
        <p>An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.</p>
        <p>A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.</p>
        <p>The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>
        <p>The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>
        <p>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>
        <p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>
        <p>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</p>
        <p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:</p>
        <p>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or</p>
        <p>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.</p>
        <p>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</p>
        <p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>
        <p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.</p>
        <p>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>
        <p>4. Combined Works.</p>
        <p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:</p>
        <p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.</p>
        <p>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>
        <p>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>
        <p>d) Do one of the following:</p>
        <p>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.</p>
        <p>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.</p>
        <p>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)</p>
        <p>5. Combined Libraries.</p>
        <p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:</p>
        <p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.</p>
        <p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>
        <p>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</p>
        <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
        <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
        <p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.</p>
