        <h1>Tokens</h1>
        <p>A token is a placeholder for a value to be inserted. Laserfiche  can take advantage of tokens in a variety of ways, such as adding values to <a href="Fields_and_Templates.htm">fields</a> and certain <a href="Annotations.htm">annotations</a>, naming new documents, and creating dynamic paths.</p>
        <p> All tokens are in the format: %(<i>Token</i>). Depending on the Laserfiche client application being used, available tokens may vary.
</p>
        <p>Tokens are particularly useful as default values or when creating documents in batches, as they allow you to dynamically store information relevant to each document without having to specify each value manually.</p>
        <p>In most cases, you can insert a token into a field, name, or other property by clicking the token button (<b>&gt;</b>) and selecting the token you want to insert. You can also type a token manually.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading"><a name="Laserfic"></a>Laserfiche Repository</h2>
        <p>The following tokens can be used in your repository and in Repository Administration. For instance, they can be used to populate fields or set default field values, or when naming documents or configuring Outlook import.</p>
