        <h1>Tracing</h1>
        <p>Tracing is a troubleshooting feature that allows you to generate a log of activity in Laserfiche Cloud. This information can be helpful when attempting to fix an issue you are encountering in Laserfiche. Since tracing is resource-intensive, it should only be used for short periods of time to diagnose specific problems, generally on the request of your support contact.</p>
        <p>To enable tracing, log in to Laserfiche and go to the repository. In the upper left corner, click your user name and select <b>Options</b>. Select <b>Advanced</b>, and then select the log level you want to use. Log levels are defined below. Click <b>Start</b> and then perform the task or tasks that you want to trace, then click <b>Stop</b>.</p>
        <p>Laserfiche Cloud will display a reference ID number, which corresponds to a specific trace log that will be generated on the server side. You should then provide the reference ID to your support contact so that they can locate it for troubleshooting.</p>
        <h2>Log Levels</h2>
        <p>The following log levels are available. In general, your support contact will tell you which log level to use.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Critical:&#160;Only very important errors will be logged. This is the default setting.</li>
            <li>Important:&#160;All errors will be logged.</li>
            <li>Informational:&#160;Both errors and non-error informational messages will be logged.</li>
            <li>Debug:&#160;All errors and non-error informational messages, plus additional information about activity in Laserfiche, will be logged. This setting is only recommended when troubleshooting a specific issue.</li>
        </ul>
