        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> There must be at least one active user account with administrator privilege.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Tip:</b> Assign rights at the group level as much as possible. Access rights can be set on either individual users or on groups, but setting rights on groups and allowing the users within the groups to inherit those rights will result in needing fewer manual configuration to accomplish the same purpose, and therefore will be easier to troubleshoot and less prone to error in the future. In general, the more manual configurations you need to accomplish something, the greater overhead for administration in the future.</p>
