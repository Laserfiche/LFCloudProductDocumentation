        <h2 class="topicheading">Everyone Group</h2>
        <p>The Everyone groups is a special group that contains every user in the repository. It allows you to configure basic security and other settings for everyone in your repository quickly. The Everyone group can be viewed in <b>Repository Administration</b>. It cannot be deleted or renamed, and its membership cannot be changed, but it otherwise behaves like any other group in Laserfiche.</p>
