        <h1>Scanning with Web Scanning</h1>
        <p>Web scanning provides a streamlined scanning interface directly in your browser. Web scanning allows you to quickly capture documents without having to launch an external application. Web Scanning is optimized for capturing documents that require little or no image processing.</p>
        <p class="ex"><b>Tip</b>:&#160;If you need more advanced image enhancements, you can use <a href="Standard_Mode.htm">standard scanning mode</a>.</p>
        <p>To begin scanning using web scanning, click the <b>Scan</b> icon (<img src="Resources/Images/fb_scan_icon.png" />) and select the <b>Web scanning</b> option. The first time you scan to Laserfiche from a particular computer, you will be prompted to install the scanning component. Note that the installation for web scanning is independent of the installation for basic or standard desktop scanning, so you may be prompted to install the web scanning component even if you have already installed desktop scanning.</p>

        <h2>Preparing to Scan</h2>
        <p>Once you have selected web scanning and installed the component for it, you will be prompted to specify your scanning options. By default, web scanning will use the same options when you next scan, but you can change these options at any time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Driver type:</b>&#160;This option is determined by the type of scanner you will be using with web scanning. You can use TWAIN&#160;with a scanner that uses TWAIN&#160;drivers, WIA&#160;Scan Engine with a scanner that uses WIA&#160;drivers, or ScanConnect with a scanner that uses ISIS drivers.</li>
            <li><b>Scanner:</b>&#160;The specific scanner you will use to capture documents.</li>
            <li><b>Paper size, paper source, and color format:</b>&#160;The dimensions and other specifications of the documents you will be capturing. These may depend in part on your scanner (for example, the paper source options may vary depending on whether your scanner is a flatbed scanner).</li>
            <li><b>Advanced options:</b>&#160;Under the advanced options section, you can configure settings for your native scanner. These links will open the options for your scanner; consult your scanner's help files for more information. In this section, you can also switch to desktop scanning.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have configured your scanning options and selected <b>Save</b>, you can begin scanning.</p>
        <h2>Scanning Documents</h2>
        <p>To start, select <b>Begin scanning</b>. Web scanning will scan the documents in your scanner according to the options you specified. Once all your pages have been scanned, you can split them into multiple documents, rearrange them, rotate them, or scan more documents.</p>
        <p class="ex"><b>Tip</b>:&#160;Keyboard shortcuts are available for most scanning operations. See <a href="#Keyboard">Keyboard Shortcuts</a>, below, for more information.</p>
        <h3><a name="Previewi"></a>Previewing Pages</h3>
        <p>To view a larger version of a scanned page, you can select <b>Show Preview</b> in the upper right corner. This will open the preview pane. You can specify the zoom level of the document, and use the rotate button (<img src="Resources/Images/web_scanning_rotate_button.png" />)&#160;to rotate the page to its correct orientation.</p>
        <h3>Splitting Documents</h3>
        <p>There are several ways to split a batch of scanned pages into individual documents. You can select one or more pages and drag and drop them in the <b>Drag pages here to create a new document</b> section at the bottom of the scanning dialog box. Alternately, you can select one or more documents, right-click, and select <b>Move Pages To</b> and then <b>New Document</b>. You can also select a document, right-click, and select <b>Split Here</b> to move the selected page and all subsequent pages to a new document.</p>
        <p>Once a new document has been created, you can add additional pages to that document via any of the above methods. You can also create additional new documents.</p>
        <h3>Rearranging Pages</h3>
        <p>You can rearrange pages either within a document or between documents by selecting one or more pages and dragging and dropping them to the new location, or by selecting one or more pages, right-clicking, and selecting <b>Cut</b>. The cut pages can then be pasted into another document.</p>
        <h3>Rotating and Deleting Pages</h3>
        <p>If pages were scanned in the wrong orientation, you can right-click one or more pages and select <b>Rotate Clockwise</b> or <b>Rotate Counterclockwise</b>. Pages can also be rotated in the preview pane (see <a href="#Previewi">Previewing Pages</a>, above). You can also remove extraneous pages by selecting one or more pages and pressing the Delete key, or right-clicking and selecting <b>Delete</b>. You can also delete an entire document by selecting the <b>Delete</b> link.</p>
        <h3>Scanning Additional Pages and Rescanning Existing Pages</h3>
        <p>To scan additional pages into an existing document in the scanning dialog box, select the <b>Add</b> button. New pages will be scanned using your existing scanning options. To scan additional pages as a new document, select the <b>Scan new document</b> button. You can also rescan existing pages by selecting a, right-clicking, and selecting <b>Rescan Page With</b>, and then selecting either <b>Same Options</b> or <b>Different Options</b>. For example, you may choose to scan most of your document pages in black and white to reduce file sizes, but you might want to rescan pages with illustrations in color or grayscale; in that case, you might choose to rescan with different options. If you select <b>Different Options</b>, you will be prompted to provide scanning options. (Note that you cannot change your driver type or scanner when rescanning with different options.)</p>
        <h2>Storing Scanned Documents</h2>
        <p>When you have completed scanning your document or documents, select OK&#160;to save the documents to the repository. The import dialog box will open, allowing you to specify a document name, where to save the document, template and field information, tags, and location data. The document(s) will be OCRed during the import process.&#160;See <a href="Importing_Files.htm">Importing Files</a> for more information.</p>
