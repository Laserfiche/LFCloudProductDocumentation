        <h1>Working with Audio and Video Media Files</h1>
        <p>Laserfiche provides special functionality to help you more easily work with audio and video media files.</p>
        <h2>Importing Audio and Video Files</h2>
        <p>Audio and video files can be imported into Laserfiche in the same way that any other file can: via the Import command, drag and drop, or using additional modules such as Import Agent. See <a href="Importing.htm">Importing</a> for more information.</p>
        <h2>Viewing Audio and Video Files</h2>
        <p>By default, opening an audio or video file will stream that file to your browser, allowing you to watch or listen to it without downloading and then opening it. You can also download audio and video files to open in their native application on your computer. See <a href="Viewing_Documents.htm#Streamin">Viewing Audio and Video Files</a> for more information.</p>
        <h2>Working with Audio and Video Files</h2>
        <p>In addition to allowing you to view audio and videos directly in the browser, Laserfiche can also transcribe audio and video files. This makes their content searchable, and can be viewed side-by-side with the video. For example, you could transcribe a recorded meeting in which the "Anderson project" was mentioned, and then later locate that video using full-text searches.</p>
        <p>Once a document has been transcribed, you can view the transcript in the document viewer (see Viewing Audio and Video Files for more information), or perform text searches for audio and video content and jump directly to the timestamp in the file that correlates to your keyword (see <a href="Search.htm">Searching</a> for more information).</p>
        <p>By default, video and audio files will automatically be transcribed on import. Media files that were imported before June 9, 2022 need to be manually transcribed to become searchable or to be viewed alongside the video.<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.Do not include"> In addition, administrators can control whether transcription is automatically performed on import to the repository. To do so, open the app picker and select <b>Repository Administration</b>. In the <b>General</b> tab, disable <b>Automatically transcribe audio and video files upon import</b>. You can resume automatic transcription by enabling this option.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
        <p>To request a transcript of an un-transcribed media file, either select the document in the folder browser or open it in the document viewer, then select the <b>More Actions</b> button. Select <b>Request Transcript</b> to add the document to the transcription queue. Note that transcription requests, both manual and automatic, are not instantaneous; it may take some time for the transcription process to be completed, depending on both the number of documents in the queue and the size of the documents.</p>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> The availability of transcription, and the number of hours of transcription you have available, depend on your Laserfiche Cloud plan, and can be viewed on the Plan section of the Account Administration page.</p>
