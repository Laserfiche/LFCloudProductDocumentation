        <h1>Working with Documents and Folders</h1>
        <p>There are a variety of ways to work with documents and folders in your repository. You can open documents and view their contents, organize entries into a logical folder structure, make changes to document contents,  check out a document to make changes to it over time, and save your changes. You can also add metadata and annotations to documents, and launch business processes from relevant documents.</p>
        <p>You can work with documents in the Folder Browser and Document Viewer. (Since folders and shortcuts cannot be opened in the Document Viewer, they are always worked with in the Folder Browser.) In general, actions that apply to the entire document (such as moving it from one folder to another or renaming it)&#160;are performed in the Folder Browser, and actions that apply to part of a document (such as rearranging pages or adding annotations) are performed in the Document Viewer. However, many tasks can be performed from either.</p>
