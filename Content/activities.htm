        <h1>Activities</h1>
        <p>There are two  kinds of activities in <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.LF Forms" />: <b>tasks</b> and <b>sub-processes</b>. Tasks are activities performed by a user (<b>user tasks</b>) or an application (<b>service tasks</b>). Sub-processes are processes that occur within the larger business process you are creating. Like the processes they are a part of, sub-processes contain their own start and end events.</p>
        <h2 class="topicheading">User Tasks</h2>
        <p>User tasks represent actions by participants in a business process. For example, a manager approving a form submission or a user revising a previously submitted form would be represented with user tasks.</p>
        <h3>Why use a user task?</h3>
        <p>Use a user task if someone needs to take action in the business process. If a user should be notified  but will not take action, use an email service task. Public users cannot participate in user tasks. </p>
        <h3>Configuring general options</h3>
        <p>Select how users can interact with this task.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the form read-only for users who are completing this task, select the <b>Make this form read-only for users this task is assigned to</b> check box.</li>
            <li>To allow users to perform this task using the details pane, select <b>Allow direct approval</b>. </li>
            <li>The Assign tab will assign the task to the users or team you specify. To allow users and team managers to reassign the task after it's been automatically assigned, select <b>Allow the task to be reassigned</b>. If this option is selected, users will have a <b>Reassign</b> option  that lets them assign the task to another user or team. If this option is cleared, users can only assign the task to themselves but not to anyone else. </li>
            <li>Select the <b>Automatically load the next task if the same person is assigned to it</b> option if the next user task in the process is assigned to the same individual as this task and if you want the next user task's form to appear immediately after the user submits this user task's form. </li>
            <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> This option will only automatically load tasks if the tasks are assigned to the same user. It will not automatically load tasks if the tasks are assigned to a group of users or team, even if the user completing the task is in both groups or teams. </p>
            <li>Under <b>Action Buttons</b>, select the check-box next to each button you want visible to the user performing this task. In the field next to each button, you can change its text.</li>
            <li>Under <b>Due Date</b>, specify when this task must be completed by. Configuring due dates gives users a way to organize and prioritize tasks and provides helpful reporting metrics for managers. You can define an exact due date, a relative due date based on a variable in your process, or no due date at all. </li>
            <li>Under <b>Priority</b>, configure conditions that can change the task's priority. A task's priority appears in the My Tasks section and helps call attention to the task.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assigning the Task</h3>
        <p>Tasks can be automatically assigned to users or a <a href="Teams.htm">team</a>. Tasks can also be reassigned during the process to allow for more flexibility.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Assign tab, select if you want to assign the task to one or more users by selecting <b>Users</b>. Alternatively, select <b>Team</b> to assign the task to a team. </li>
            <li>If you selected <b>Users</b>, type one or more user's names. Click the variable button to assign the task based on a field value or process variable.</li>
            <li>If you selected <b>Teams</b>, chose a team from the drop-down menu. You can also create teams from this menu by selecting <b>Create team</b>.<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;"><li><b>Optional:</b> You can select or create a filter that assigns the task  to specific members of the team based on certain criteria.  <a href="Creating-Team-Filters.htm" title="Click here to learn more." alt="Click here to learn more.">Learn more about filters.</a></li><li>Under <b>Task Distribution</b>, select if the task will go to the team in general (and appear in the team member's <b>Available</b> tab) or if the task will be automatically assigned to a single team member following a round-robin pattern. If you select <b>Round robin</b>, and the task has never been assigned to a team member before, a team member will be randomly assigned the task. Future tasks will go to the user who has been assigned this user task (either automatically or manually reassigned the task) least recently. If the task is assigned to a user and they release the task, it will go to the team's <b>Available</b> tab, it will not be reassigned round-robin. </li></ol></li>
            <li>Select the check-box next to <b>Email users when this task is assigned</b> to email users assigned to this task when this task is first assigned to them. </li>
            <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Users will not receive this notification if the task is manually reassigned to them. They will only receive this notification when the process runs this user task. </p>
            <li>To include field or process information in the subject or body of the email message, click the <b>Insert Variable</b><img src="Resources/Images/insert variable.png" title="Variable button" alt="Variable button (right arrow)" />button.</li>
            <li>Click <b>Done</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 class="topicheading">Service Tasks</h2>
        <p>
            <MadCap:concept term="Forms" />Service tasks represent actions by a service or program in a business process. For example, sending an email notification to users involved in the process is a service task because it is performed by <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.LF Forms" />.</p>
        <h3>Why use a service task?</h3>
        <p>Use a service task for sending an email notification or saving a form to your <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.Laserfiche" /> repository. If a user must take action as part of the task, use a user task instead.</p>
        <h3><a name="Email"></a>Email service task</h3>
        <p>Email service tasks automatically send an email to one or more users at a specified point in the business process. These service tasks are useful if a user does not have to take action in a process but should still be kept informed of its progress.</p>
        <p><b>To send an email during a process</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li MadCap:conditions="Default.In Progress">Place a <b>Email Service Task</b> onto the canvas and connect it to the objects that precede and follow it in the process.</li>
            <li>Double-click the task to view its <b>Properties</b>.</li>
            <li>Fill in the <b>From</b>, <b>Send to</b>, <b>Subject</b>, and <b>Body</b> fields. Click the <b>Insert Variable</b> button <img src="Resources/Images/insert variable.png" alt="Variable button (right arrow)" title="Variable button" /> to insert a placeholder for process or field information such as the name of the person who started the process, the submitter, any user task actions or comments, and field values.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Save to Repository service task</h3>
        <p>

        <h2 class="topicheading">Configuring Outflow</h2>
        <p><a href="Outflow.htm">Outflow settings</a> let you specify when a particular pathway in your process should run. For example, after a user task in which a manager approves or denies a form, outflow settings let you designate one course of action for an approved form and another course for a denied form. </p>
