        <h1>Creating a Form</h1>
        <p>Forms capture information within a business process. To create a form, first create the business process that it is a part of. Forms only exist within a specific process. There are several places in <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.LF Forms" /> where you can create a form.</p>
        <p><b>From the sidebar</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Under the <b>FORMS</b> section, click <b>Create New Form</b>.</li>
            <li>Name the form and click <b>Create</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>From the Process Designer</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the configuration pane for a message event or user task, in the From drop-down list, click <b>Create New Form</b>.</li>
            <li>Name the form and click <b>Create</b>.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note"><b>Note:</b> Form names cannot be longer than 50 characters.</p>
        <p>The Edit page allows you to configure fields on a form. Your changes to the form will be automatically saved. To see a preview of your form, click <img src="../../../Trunk/English/Administration/Subprojects/Forms/Content/Resources/Images/FormPreview.png" title="form preview icon" alt="form preview icon"></img><b>Preview</b>.</p>

They accept numbers and characters, making them well suited for accepting names, numbers, and many other values. If there's a chance that the user filling in this field will enter a combination of characters and numbers, you should use a single line field rather than a more specialized one.
                        <p>Single line fields are also incredibly useful because you can use regular expressions with them to restrict what the field accepts. In addition, single line fields can accept <MadCap:variable name="DoNotTranslate.HTML" /> input.</p></td>
