        <h1>Introduction to Forms</h1>
        <p>Laserfiche Forms allows organizations to collect, process, and route information electronically. In Laserfiche Forms, you can create web forms to collect or work with information, as well as business processes to define how that information is routed, interacted with, and managed.</p>
        <p>The routing of a Laserfiche Forms business process is diagrammed through the Process Modeler, which is based on business process model and notation (BPMN) standards. Different forms can be associated with each step of the business process, allowing form creators to tailor the presentation of information for the specific step and/or users.</p>
