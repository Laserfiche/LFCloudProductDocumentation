        <h1>Verifying if You Have a Mailbox in Exchange Online</h1>
        <p>The Laserfiche Outlook Add-in for Microsoft 365 requires a user mailbox in Exchange Online. If you are using Office 365, but are connecting to Exchange Server (on-premises), you will not be able to access the Laserfiche Outlook Add-in for Microsoft 365.</p>
        <p>The following steps show how to check your Outlook connection information.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>When Outlook is running, CTRL + right-click on the Outlook icon in the Windows taskbar notification area (<img src="Images/outlook.png" />). </li>
            <li>In the context menu, click <b>Connection Status</b> to open the Outlook Connection Status dialog box.</li>
            <li>Under the <b>Server name</b> column, verify that the appropriate mailbox is connecting to <i>Office365.com</i>. If the mailbox is connecting to a corporate domain, that indicates that you are connecting to Exchange Server (on-premises), and will not be able to use the Laserfiche Outlook Add-in for Microsoft 365.</li>
        </ol>
