        <h1>July 2018 Updates to Laserfiche Cloud </h1>
        <p>The July 2018 update for Laserfiche Cloud includes many new features, as well as updates to existing features.</p>
        <p>Watch an overview of the new features here:<iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/New-Features-in-Cloud-July-2018/New-Features-in-Cloud-July-2018_player.html"></iframe></p>
        <h2>Document Updates </h2>
        <p><b>Locations</b>
        </p>
        <p>You can now associate  location information with documents. Locations allow you to add a map location to a document or folder in Laserfiche. When an entry has a location set, users can view the location on a map within the folder browser or document viewer using Google Maps, and can perform searches for documents near a specific location. For example, maintenance requests might be stored with locations indicating the property that needs maintenance; when a worker goes to perform the maintenance, they could search for all properties in a particular vicinity that have open maintenance requests.</p>
        <p>Location information can be automatically generated from the EXIF&#160;data of a JPG file if that file has location data associated with it. It can also be manually assigned. A location consists of both the actual map location data and an optional text description; you can search for either proximity to the location, the location description, or a combination of both. </p>
        <p><b>Multiple Holds</b>
        </p>
        <p>Holds (formerly known as freezes)&#160;prevent modification to entries, and halts their records management life cycle if they are records. You can now apply holds to entries that are not records, easily apply the same hold to multiple entries, and apply multiple holds to a single entry; an entry will only become modifiable again and continue its life cycle once all the holds have been removed. In addition, you can now add and search for due dates on holds.</p>
        <p><b>New Features for Microsoft Office Documents</b>
        </p>
        <p>When the Office Integration is installed, users can now open Microsoft Office documents seamlessly with a single click, without needing to specify 'view' or 'edit,' or to manually check out the document. </p>
        <p>Users can also choose to create blank Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents within the folder browser. This allows you to quickly create a document and begin work on it, without needing to create it outside the repository and then import it.</p>
        <p><b>EML Email Format Support</b>
        </p>
        <p>Laserfiche now includes native support for EML email messages. This allows you to take advantage of email features in Laserfiche previously only available to MSG email messages.</p>
        <p><b>Performance Improvement</b>
        </p>
        <p>The July 2018 release of Laserfiche Cloud includes numerous bug fixes and performance enhancements.</p>
        <h2>Laserfiche App Updates</h2>
        <p><b>Location</b>
        </p>
        <p>A location can now be added to a newly uploaded photo or electronic document. This location can be extracted from a photo's EXIF data, retrieved from the device's current location, or selected on a map. You can search by location description and the location can be modified, deleted, and edited in the Metadata pane.</p>
        <p><b>Sync</b>
        </p>
        <p>Users no longer have to press the sync button to sign out and back in to sync their offline and online information. Offline documents and folders will be automatically synced when the Laserfiche app is minimized and then maximized on Android and iOS.</p>
        <p><b>Recycle Bin</b>
        </p>
        <p>When deleting documents, pages, electronic files, or folders, the items can now be sent to a recycle bin instead of immediately deleted. This intermediary hold area can help prevent accidental deletion while using the app.</p>
        <h2>Public Portal Updates</h2>
        <p><b>Search within a Document</b>
        </p>
        <p>When users have documents open in Public Portal, they can now easily search within that document's contents.</p>
        <p><b>Hyperlinks in Document Text and Fields</b>
        </p>
        <p>When a document's text or fields contain hyperlinks, those hyperlinks will now automatically be rendered as clickable links. This makes it easy for users to locate related documents or other information.</p>
        <p><b>Document Preview</b>
        </p>
        <p>The details pane now features the ability to preview the pages of a document before opening it, allowing users to easily see if a document is the one they need.</p>
