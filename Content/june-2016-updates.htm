        <h1>June 2016 Updates for Laserfiche Cloud</h1>
        <p>The June 2016 update of Laserfiche Cloud introduces Laserfiche Forms for Cloud as well as a variety of new features to make it easier to work with documents in your repository, including new ways of viewing information about your documents and folders.</p>
        <p>You can watch an overview of the new features here:</p><iframe width="100%" height="557" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/Whats-New-in-Cloud-June-2016/Whats-New-in-Cloud-June-2016.html"></iframe>
        <h2>Forms</h2>
        <p>Laserfiche Forms is a significant addition to Laserfiche Cloud that lets you easily create online forms for users to fill out and submit. These forms can be incorporated into larger approval or routing processes. Users can complete, assign, and prioritize process-related tasks from a centralized task list. With Forms, it’s easy to capture the information you need, route it appropriately, and process it efficiently.</p>
        <h2>View PDF Documents in the Document Viewer</h2>
        <p>You can now open PDF documents directly in the document viewer, without needing to download and open them locally. With this feature, you can view these document types in the same way you would an imaged document. Metadata and other information about the document is immediately available right in the details pane of the document viewer.</p>
        <h2>Preview Documents During Import</h2>
        <p>When importing images or a PDF file into Laserfiche, you will now be provided with a preview of the images or PDF directly in the import dialog. This allows you to refer to the document if you need additional information to help you file the document or provide its metadata.</p>
        <h2>Open Audit Reports Directly from Entries</h2>
        <p>Authorized users can now directly open an audit report for information on that entry. For instance, you might want to be able to see the history of who accessed or modified the document. Once you have configured the relevant audit reports in Audit Trail Reporter, you can launch them for a specific entry directly from the document.</p>
        <h2>Compare Versions for Microsoft Office Documents</h2>
        <p>You can now compare changes when viewing version information for Microsoft Office documents stored in Laserfiche. When comparing changes, differences between the versions will be displayed using the native Microsoft Office revision markup, allowing you to quickly locate what was changed between two versions. This functionality is supported with Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, and PowerPoint presentations.</p>
        <h2>Apply Column Profiles to Search Results</h2>
        <p>Column profiles allow you to save sets of folder browser columns and then quickly apply them to view different information about entries. You can apply column profiles to search results as well as to regular folders.</p>
        <h2>Copy Text from Document Images</h2>
        <p>You can now copy text directly from the images in Laserfiche documents, allowing you to quickly populate metadata with copy and paste. Using the new Select Text command will retrieve the OCRed text from the selected portion of the document and copy it to the clipboard, allowing you to easily paste it anywhere you choose.</p>
        <h2>Import Agent</h2>
        <p>Import Agent has been optimized for use with Laserfiche Cloud. It now imports documents significantly faster, supports multiple threads on multi-core machines, has a new look, and more.</p>
