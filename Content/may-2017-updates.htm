        <h1>May 2017 Updates for Laserfiche Cloud</h1>
        <p>The May 2017 update of Laserfiche Cloud includes a variety of updates to multiple apps in Laserfiche Cloud.</p>
        <p>You can watch an overview of the new features here:</p><iframe width="100%" height="550" src="https://doc.laserfiche.com/laserfiche.documentation/english/videos/Whats-New-in-Cloud-May-2017/Whats-New-in-Cloud-May-2017_player.html"></iframe>
        <h2>Web Client Updates</h2>
        <p><b>Multi-Value Field Groups</b>
        </p>
        <p>In some cases, values across multiple fields on a single document may be related to one another. For example, on an invoice, you might have multiple items, each with its own name, product code, price, and amount purchased. On a report, you may have multiple authors, each of whom has an email address associated with them. While multi-value fields allow you to store multiple values, it can be difficult to tell at a glance which price corresponds to which item, or which author has which email address.</p>
        <p>Multi-value field groups solve this problem by allowing you to specify that multiple multi-value fields are related. You could associate the “Product Name,” “Product Code,” “Price,” and “Amount Purchased” multi-value fields as all belonging to the same group within the “Invoice” template. Then, when a user opens a document with that template, they will be able to see which name, code, price, and amount purchased values go together, and to add or modify more invoice items appropriately.</p>
        <p><b>Repository Administration</b>
        </p>
        <p>The Repository Administration page has been updated with a  streamlined and responsive design. Use the updated page to work with repository settings, users and groups, repository activity, metadata definitions, and records management definitions.</p>
        <h2>Forms Updates</h2>
        <p><b>Updated Site Navigation</b>
        </p>
        <p>The Forms site header now links to all major pages in Forms. This includes moving the Start Process button out of the Tasks page into the header. There are now two views for starting a process: you can choose between viewing a list of processes and a grid view that displays thumbnails of the form. Choosing to view reports now guides you to select a process first. When working with the process designer and forms designer, you now have the option of always displaying a sidebar that allows you to quickly navigate between process options, the process designer, and forms designer.</p>
        <p><b>Landing Page</b>
        </p>
        <p>New landing pages make finding and viewing processes easier. The new Landing Pages are configurable pages that  list processes relevant to different users. For example, you could create a landing page for all Human Resources processes or for all Public processes. Each landing page has a custom URL for users to access it directly.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude"><b>Braintree Payment Gateway Support</b>
        </p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude">The Payment Collection option lets you collect payment via Braintree as part of a Message Start Event. Users will be prompted to enter payment information to pay the amount specified in the event. Administrators can see the transaction information on the instance’s history page. Non-payment related metadata about the transaction is available as tokens for use in later forms or process activities.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Exclude">The integration requires an existing merchant account with Braintree.  All payment processing is handled by Braintree through the Braintree Drop-in UI. Laserfiche Forms does not store or have access to submitted payment information. For example, when saving a draft, no payment information can be saved. For more information on Braintree, please see Braintree resources on the Braintree Drop-in UI feature: https://www.braintreepayments.com/products-and-features/drop-in-ui.</p>
