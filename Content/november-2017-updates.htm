        <h2>Account Administration Site Updates</h2>
        <p><b>Email Notifications</b>
        </p>
        <p>The account administration site can now send email notifications when an account approaches storage limits. Subscribe to receive notifications when storage usage meets the following thresholds: 75%, 90%, 95%, and 100%. Solution Providers can also subscribe to alerts for customer accounts.</p>
        <p><b>Account Management Updates</b>
        </p>
        <p>Laserfiche Cloud has streamlined the process of managing users and assigning them rights. A new context menu and toolbar lets you quickly access options for managing users and groups. Additionally, administrators can now choose from preset profiles to quickly assign access rights.</p>
        <p><b>Skip the Trial Stage</b>
        </p>
        <p>Previously, new customers had to go through a Demo stage and then a Trial stage before activating their customer account. For customers that are immediately ready for production use, Solution Providers can now go straight to activation from a Demo account and skip the Trial stage altogether.</p>
