        <h1>Monitoring the Data Transfer Process when Importing Data from Self-hosted Laserfiche to Laserfiche Cloud</h1>
        <p>Authorized Solution Providers can use the <b>Repository Import Monitor</b> application to view the status of migrations for their customers. Authorized Solution Providers may also be able to perform certain administrative functions like generating a registration code for the <a href="repositoryimport.htm">Repository Export Client</a>.</p>
        <p>Select the Repository Import Monitor (<img src="Images/repoimportapppicker.png" title="Screenshot of Repository Import Monitor in app picker" alt="Screenshot of Repository Import Monitor in app picker" style="border-style:solid; border-width:1px" />) item from the app picker or from the Overview page.</p>
        <p>The default view provides a list of your customers. Use the <b>Status</b> filter
  located above the list to view customers with a specific migration process or use the <b>Filter accounts</b> search field to type in a specific customer name.</p>
        <p>Click on a customer to view information related to that customer's repository import.</p>
        <p>The <MadCap:toggler targets="generaltab">General tab</MadCap:toggler> provides a high level overview of the current status of the data import process. By default, you must contact Laserfiche Support to initiate an import and generate a registration code. In certain situations, authorized solution providers may also be able to initiate an import process to generate a registration code. You will also be able to download the <a href="repositoryimport.htm">Repository Export Client</a> from this page.</p>
        <p>During the "Migrate" step, the page will display the status (e.g., Initiated, Migrating Database %, Migrating Volume %, Completed) of the migration and contain a link to the Log tab. Completed migrations will contain an option to download a report.</p>
        <p>Do not attempt to use the Laserfiche Cloud repository during the <b>Migrating Database</b> status. </p>
        <p>The repository becomes available for use during the <b>Migrating Volume</b> status. However, please be aware that the import process is still in progress and that select documents and repository functions may be limited until the migration is fully completed. During the volume migration step, users can access the repository to create new entries, and perform any actions on migrated or new entries. For entries where the volume migration is in progress, users will be able to view the metadata or security of the affected entry and star the affected entry.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The <MadCap:toggler targets="logtab">Log tab</MadCap:toggler> provides a more detailed time line of actions performed during the import process.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The <MadCap:toggler targets="troubleshootingtab">Troubleshooting tab</MadCap:toggler> allows authorized Solution Providers to try to resume an import process if the data upload was interrupted. They can also attempt to retry certain aspects of the migration should they encounter errors during those steps. Please see <a href="https://support.laserfiche.com/kb/1014402" target="_parent">Knowledge Base article 1014402</a> for details on supported actions.</p>
