            <li>Form Lookup Rules now support Web Request rules from both the form designer and classic form designer.

Native access to web request rules in forms lets designers easily integrate 3rd party data sources using potentially complex APIs, including the Laserfiche API. These web request rules are now secured by Laserfiche and the underlying authentication credentials are not exposed to the user like they would be when executed through custom JavaScript.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>As part of service stability optimizations, account administrators can no longer choose to bulk email multiple users at the same time. The changes include:<ul><li>The <b>Verify email</b> and <b>Send password email</b> options have been removed from the toolbar and right-click shortcut menu. Administrators can click on the "Verify" link in the email column to send a verification email to a user and  users can verify their email from their profile page. Users can reset their password using the Forgot password option on the sign-in page.</li><li> The <b>Import from CSV</b> feature's <b>Import Users</b> dialog no longer includes the <b>Send a password setup email</b> and  <b>Send email verification</b> options.
